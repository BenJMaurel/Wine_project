2019 CABERNET SAUVIGNON Camina,8.5,A real gentle soul this, a subtle leafiness, then a medium weight of plum and cassis, soft but with a definite tannic structure, this is as easy as they come.
2019 CAMINA Tempranillo,8.5,Juicy cranberry and redcurrant fruits on the nose here with just a touch of spiciness. The palate is soft with some nice red fruit weight, a little bit earthy and some mocha notes on the smooth finish.
2018 MERLOT-CABERNET-CARIGNAN Domaine Saint Félix,8.5,Ripely juicy and bright with a core of red fruits, cherry and plum, undercut by some notes of tobacco and tea leaf. Good weight and richness of fruit, with supple but rich tannins and a lovely easy going mocha note on the finish.
2019 MERLOT Domaine les Yeuses,8.5,NaN
2019 LA PETITE SYRAH Domaine les Yeuses,8.5,The 2019 is another little gem from Domaine Les Yeuses. At this brilliant level it is hard to find such a good and identifiable Syrah. This is good - there is nice lift and spice. The fruit is dark, with blackberry and damson notes, Yet not overly cooked nor too sweet - and there is just enough savour to let you know this has a serious side too. At this level this is seriously impressive and remarkably refined. Well judged and fun to drink.
2019 GARNACHA Bodegas y Viñedos Monfil,8.5,There is a joyous nose of dark cherry, damson and raspberry, all backed by a lively pepperiness. Smooth and supple and not in any way heavy (which is something lesser Garnachas can lean towards).
2018 OLD HANDS Monastrell Ecológico Bodegas La Purisima,9.5,Yet again this collective of old farmers in Yecla, the 'Old Hands' have come up trumps. Organically grown Monastrell (Mourvedre) is picked at perfect ripeness and results in this startling value red. Juicy and loaded with dried herb and clovespice the dark, plummy flesh is richly satisfying without ever crossing the line into 'too much.' A side swipe of crisper, cherry-skin bite keeps this very much alive. Incredible price for a wine that gives so much joy.
2019 MERLOT Chemin de la Pinède,9.5,A lithe juicy yep supple red from the Languedoc, filled with bright cassis, cherry and blueberry fruit. In the mouth the berry fruitiness is underpinned with notes of mocha and a gentle earthiness. Really easy-going but with plenty of depth.
2018 GAUDOU 'EXCEPTION' MALBEC Fabrice Durou,9.95,The grapes come from Cahors, but Fabrice declassifies this cuvée so as to be able to make it as he wants. Stylish dark violet-inflected fruit with a touch of earth.
2019 PRIMITIVO Salento Cantine de Falco,9.95,From just outside Lecce in the heart of Salento comes this cracking example of Primitivo. Bright and perky this has a fine zippy line that makes it not only food friendly but very moreish. Cherry skin and cooked damson and delightful drop from the sunny heel of Italy.
2019 NEGROAMARO Salento Cantine de Falco,9.95,Another absolute cracker from Cantine de Falco, bursting from the glass with aromas of cherries, blueberries and strawberries and a distinct herbal top note. In the mouth this is fresh and lithe, sleekly fruity, berried fruits, perfumed and seductive, with a touch of creaminess and herbs on the finish. It truly encapsulates the Puglian sunshine.
2018 MERLOT Domaine de Valensac,9.95,NaN
2019 LE CLOS Domaine Sainte Eugénie,10.95,Fragrant and fruit filled with damson, blackberry, dark cherry and a note of dark chocolate. Sleek and supple in the mouth, the fruit has a lovely primary feel that makes this super drinkable from the off. 
2017 ROAN RANGER Cinsault Grenache Mourvèdre Withington,10.5,As the name comedically suggests, the Roan ranger is inspired by and nicely apes the Rhône valley style of wine. Nice plump ripe fruit with a healthy dose of sweet peppery spice.
2018 TALENTO Monastrell Ecológico Ego Bodegas,10.95,Harvest is quite late here to allow the Monastrell (Mouvedre) to reach peak maturity - and the grapes are brought in during the first week of October. The estate works organically and the Monastrell vines are now more than 25 years old. This explains the great depth of fruit and complex aromas. This is 'Bandol on a budget' with softer edges - and totally delicious! Dark cherry compote and lovely wood spice makes this so enjoyable. To maintain that fruit expression, the wine ages for just 2 months in american oak barrels - this adds a creamy note and a softness - without leaving any discernible 'oakiness'. Another brilliant wine from our burgeoning Spanish selection.
2017 OLD VINE ZINFANDEL Scotto Family Vineyards,10.95,NaN
2018 CHÂTEAU BELLEVUE LA FORÊT Côtes du Frontonnais,11.5,We love this prime estate in the heart of Fronton - about half an hour north of Toulouse in the rustique South West. There is nothing rustic about htis smart red though! Deep ruby in colour. Fresh bouquet with intense aromas of red fruit and blackcurrants. Complex and sophisticated on the palate with a note of liquorice, wood-smoke and a touch of green pepper. Fresh and unctuous initially, then tasting fruity and spicy. Good length, a really fine feel for a wine that's ready for drinking now. Watch out Bordeaux - this is remarkable value.
2016 LEA & SANDEMAN Bordeaux,11.95,2016 was a super vintage here - and we are delighted with this new release of our hugely popular, own-label Claret. As ever this comes from a fabulous small estate near the village of Gensac in the Entre-Deux-Mers. Just a moment in oak - this top value Bordeaux is loaded with lovely plummy red fruit - some cigar box spices and just the right amount of grip and some juicy acidity. Bright and hugely satisfying Bordeaux for an unbelievably good price!
2018 CHÂTEAU BELLE GARDE Bordeaux,11.5,From a good vintage and always delivering incredible value for money, Eric Duffau's brilliant Château Belle Garde is one of our longest standing listings. Leaf tea, cassis, plum and tobacco aromas are backed by a well balanced palate. Again dark fruited, with some nice tannic structure, this has lovely definition with the tobacco and cedar notes allowing for a sleek finish.
2019 GARNACHA SYRAH Bodegaverde,11.95,This red has such an open and inviting personality, it is hard not to fall for it from the first sniff. There is pungency of ripe red and black fruits, glossy and warming, it is filled with sunshine. But the palate plays a beautiful balancing act between rich fruitiness, blackberry, strawberry and plum, some darker chocolate and liquorice notes and then a sleek fresh acidity pushing the whole thing along and making it so easy to drink.
2018 PUY-DE-DÔME PINOT NOIR Cave de Verny,11.5,From the land of extinct volcanoes, wine-making very nearly died out here, but some of the growers that remained got together to form the Caves de Verny. This gave them a home for their grapes and the means to produce a wine of consistent character and quality. You very much feel the volcanic influence in this robust but fruit filled red. Damson and raspberry dominate on the nose, with a whiff of crushed stones and then in the mouth a deep draft of dark fleshy fruit with a stalky tannic grip and bright balancing acidity.
2018 MUNIA TORO Roble 8 Meses Bodegas Viñaguareña,11.95,Made with fruit from the estate's vineyards right above the banks of the Guareña river, (a tributary of the Douro) this pure Tinta de Toro (Tempranillo) is loaded with delicious expressive fruit notes from the very old vines. Silky, deep purple berry flesh is pepped up by fresh lines and beautiful spiced aromatics. There is a touch of church incense, some cinnamon - pretty, dried rose petals and plenty of deep black and red fruit. Damsons and blackberries dominate the mid palate and the 'just there', fresh acidity keeps the flow steady. Engaging and delicious - this could be your new favourite for the Autumn! 8 months in a mix of French and American oak barrels certainly add spice and some shape - but stop short of leaving a deep oaky impression. Very moreish.
2018 CHÂTEAU MURET Cru Bourgeois Haut Médoc,11.95,Youthful, perhaps, but this is ready to go and an absolute delight a the price, with deep colour, and an inviting spicy fruit nose. The most remarkable element of the tasting at this stage is the suppleness of the cool weight of the wine on the entry - ultra-fine tannins giving real sophistication to the ripe juiciness. The finish extends the flavours with a subtle grip. Great value for a wine with impeccable provenance on the northern border of Saint Estèphe in Saint Seurin de Cadourne.
2017 MINERVOIS Calamiac Terroir Domaine Combe Blanche,11.95,Another brilliant wine from Guy Vanlancker, this wine shouts of its place so beautifully and with no little complexity. Always with a whiff of the garrigue, wild herbs, rosemary, fennel and lovely wild black fruits, blackberry, damson, myrtle and loganberry. There is a lovely cut to this wine, generously proportion, sleek and rich, with cracking aromatics, unencumbered by any oak influence. An absolute joy.
2016 REY DON GARCIA RIOJA Crianza Bodegas Ruconia,11.95,A lovely Crianza from Bodegas Ruconia. This is a firm favourite at L&S. Lots of lively cherry fruit wrapped up in attractive vanilla oak. Medium bodied, the wine holds a good high tone throughout. Another Rioja that offers excellent value for money.
2018 PRIOS MAXIMUS Roble Bodegas de Los Rios Prieto,11.95,100% Tempranillo hand harvested from the Pesquera vineyards from 25 year old vines, then aged for 6 months in American oak barrels. Intense, fresh red cherries, blackberries and redcurrants on the palate, with lovely smooth tannins. Really well balanced - a beautiful accompaniment to tapas and charcuterie. 
2016 THE RED MULLET Pikes Polish Hill River Estate,11.95,A wonderful melange of different varieties go into this flavoursome red from Pikes. Shiraz, merlot, sangiovese and grenache meld together to produce a medium bodied, plum, blackberry, cherry and dark chocolate mouthful. Never heavy it would prove a great match for Friday night burgers.
2019 ARTUKE Rioja,12.5,The sheer drink-ability of this wine marked it out from the first time we tasted it with the 2015 release. A blend of mostly Tempranillo with a splash of Viura and made using carbonic maceration to lock in the wonderful fresh primary fruitness. This is a sappy, juicy red with damson, cherry and raspberry fruit, nicely balanced with good weight in the mouth. Serve it slightly cool with everything from meaty fish to rich chicken stews.
2019 MALBEC PENEDO BORGES Expresíon Bodegas Otaviano,12.95,NaN
2015 CHÂTEAU PUYBARBE Cuvée Apanage Côtes de Bourg,12.95,This new find is an absolute humdinger. Brilliant Bordeaux at a very sensible price. From the highest point at the heart of the Côtes de Bourg. This has all the breadth and richness you'd hope for from 2015 - but this deep fruit is so well handled, the good rich, chewy fruit has a super svelte feel. Nicely spiced too after 12 months in barrel the results are superbly harmonious. Beautifully juicy and full of pleasure this is a brilliant Bordeaux.
2018 CAHORS Cuvée Cèdre Héritage Pascal Verhaeghe,12.95,NaN
2018 SYRAH-GRENACHE Champs du Coq Domaine La Croix Belle,12.95,NaN
2019 NERO D'AVOLA Rosso Le Casematte,12.95,NaN
LAMBRUSCO Classico Monte delle Vigne,12.95,This fabulously inviting, sparkling red bursts all the myths about Lambrusco by being dry and joyously drinkable. Grown organically on clay and limestone soils the results are fantastic. Fresh bright black cherry, blackberry fruit, some attractive fermentary notes, mouthfeel is ripe and fresh, nice depth of dark cherry and plum, blackberry fruit, decent grip and fresh acidity. 100% Lambrusco Maestri.
2014 SÜD MERLOT & CO. Merlot Salomon Finniss River Estate,13.5,Bert Salomon grows his Merlot in the Finiss River region of the Fleurieu Penninsula, South Australia where it never gets too hot and the nights are super cool. This lets the Merlot retain a nice bite to its blackcurrant fruit, with a juiciness on the palate, and a pleasant tannic structure.
2019 PEZENAS ROUGE Le Pech Mégé AOC Domaine des Trinités,13.5,A blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Carignan. What a revelation this wine is. The wild intense nose has good meaty savour thrown in with the attractive dark berry fruit. And then the palate has great bounce! Despite the dark and nice brood to the fruit - this has an unmistakably mineral, slightly graphite note to it. A fresh and crisp, crunchy edge to the dark fruit, It flows well all the way to the good, bright finish. Herbs and lavender. Focused and angular. Freshness is a key aim and Simon is completely successful to this end! With a meaty Pork Chop or grilled Aubergine this will be a total delight. 
2018 LOS VASCOS Cabernet Sauvignon,12.95,NaN
2017 BAAN SHIRAZ Salomon Finniss River Estate,13.95,An Aussie Shiraz crafted in South Australia by Bert Salomon who, when not sunning it up in the Southern Hemisphere, makes delightful Austrian Grüner Veltliner and Riesling in the Kremstal in Austria. This is Aussie Shiraz, so expect some ripe fruit and a tickle of leathery spice, but there is a defter and more refreshing touch than most of its ilk which keeps the Baan really rather drinkable. 
2018 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES Domaine Rochette,NaN,Bright, fresh and fruit-filled, cherries, raspberry, touch of creme de mure. Palate has juice and lift, plenty of plum skin, cherries and raspberry fruit, delicious and mouthfilling, a lot of wine for the money.
2018 SYRAH 'Terres de Mandrin' IGP Domaine Jeanne Gaillard,13.95,A lightish, juicy Syrah in the aromatic Northern Rhone style which captures the peppery precision of Syrah of the great wines from this part of the world. A light and easy Crozes-Cornas style red.
2018 CÔTE DE BROUILLY Les Grillés Domaine Chevalier-Métrat,14.5,Red currants, raspberries and blueberries here. Beautifully fragrant and lifted. Consistent in the mouth, richly fruited again but with great freshness, flesh and weight, delivered in a lip smacking style. The cut and lift is what makes you really want to drink this. Another bargain Bojo from this latest signing.
2017 MEERLUST RED,NaN,NaN
2018 ARUMA Bodegas Caro,NaN,The smoke, black-tea and dark-berry aromas and flavors are really impressive. Hints of coffee. Full body, firm yet lightly rounded tannins and a flavorful finish. Hard not to drink now. Pure malbec. No wood. Drink now.
2019 L'ÉTRANGER 120 Year Old Vine Domaine des Trinités,14.95,Supple elegant and gently spicy, this is from seriously old vines that Simon has managed to save. Garrigue herbs, red fruits and a touch of blueberry, creamy but with rich tannin backing the fruit, it is sleek and delicious.
2016 CHÂTEAU LAURIOL Côtes de Francs,14.95,Chateau Lauriol is the 100% Merlot second wine of perennial over-achiever - Chateau Puygueraud, owned by the Thienpont family. It comes from their vineyards in the Côtes du Francs. Sleek and sophisticated this is remarkably classy for the price. The expertise of the team screams out of the glass. Indulgent Bordeaux in a lovely, modern fashion - one to open with friends and a great meal.
2018 CÔTES DU RHÔNE Domaine Romain Roche,NaN,Domaine Roche's 2018 Cotes du Rhone is a blend of 50% Grenache and 25% each Carignan and Syrah, all aged in tank. There's a slightly green edge to the lovely cherry-raspberry fruit—think something akin to green peppercorns. It's medium to full-bodied, supple and even a bit creamy in texture, finishing long and silky.
2018 BROUILLY Les Mines Domaine Chevalier-Métrat,14.95,These gnarly small bush vine are between 30 and 70 years old. Pretty nose of violets, cherry and raspberry nice intensity and freshness. Palate is richly delivered, lovely flesh, ripely fruity, perky cherries mix with smashed fresh strawberries, there is great persistence here and fabulous flow, really nice shape. A great new addition to the range.
2018 SANGIOVESE Girapoggio Bissoni,14.95,NaN
2015 PRIMITIVO DI MATERA Akratos DOC Battifarano,14.95,This is a brilliant new arrival from Basilicata and our first ever Primitivo from the Matera DOC. It jumps out of the glass at you with some complex spices and nice note of evolution on the nose, but there is a good, firm line to the dark fruit that soon takes charge. And then a sweeter pick up on the finish. A juicier rounder feel. Good power and drive, but a soft line and a nice gentle feel. Great and polished Primitivo.
2016 ABOLENGO Carmenère Syrah Peumo,15.5,60% Carmenere, 40% Syrah. This small producer is making fabulous artisan wines which have impressed us so much with their charming shape and feel. Perfectly laden with restrained, poised fruit. There is great concentration to the wonderful spicy, dark red fruit. A really stylish interpretation of what can be done here. Ripe, bold and dark, but well checked by just enough lifting acidity and a nicely structured frame. A delicious partner to hearty flavours - red meat from the pan or the Barbecue or ideal with your roast lamb.
2015 LES TOURS DE BEAUMONT Haut Médoc,14.95,60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot. Nicely ripe, a solid mouthful of Médoc from an excellent vintage and it shows - significantly more enjoyable than the 2012 Beaumont itself (this is the second wine). Excellent dark fruit - blackberry /blueberry expression and a lift of pithy tannin on the finish to keep it lively.
2018 LE COLOMBIER Massaya,14.95,Delightful favourful, gently spicy but not overdone red wine from hill-side vineyards at 900-1200m altitude in the Beqaa Valley. 35% Cinsault, 35% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 15% Tempranillo.
2019 LE PETIT ROY Domaine Jean Royer,15.95,Petit Roy is always made from the off cuts from Jean-Marie Royer's Chateauneuf vineyards and those outside of the appellation. It is a boistrous, berry-fruit filled red, fragrant herbs and spices overlaid with blackberry, cherry and plum fruit. Mouth filling and gutsy it is a great match for hearty dishes from the grill in the summer or with a cosy Kitchen supper on a chilly, dark evening.
2019 VALPOLICELLA Classico Ca' La Bionda,15.5,A beautifully pale, delicately structured style that delivers intense strawberry and cherry fruits, floral notes and just a touch of hawthorn. The palate is fresh and supple, lovely red fruit intensity, with an undercurrent of mocha and a bright juicy acidity. Very immediate and undeniably easy drinking, but with plenty of flavour to keep you going back for another sip.
2018 DOLCETTO D'ALBA Andrea Oberto,15.95,NaN
2019 CÔTES DU RHÔNE Rouge La Dame Rousse Domaine de la Mordorée,15.95,A blend of Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre brought up in tank, the 2019 Côtes Du Rhône La Dame Rousse is a big, rich, powerful Côtes du Rhône loaded with notions of smoked black cherries, licorice, scorched earth, and ample minerality. These all carry to a medium to full-bodied Southern Rhône that has terrific purity of fruit, ripe, present tannins, and a great finish. I love its balance and it’s going to deliver ample pleasure over the coming 4-6 years.
2016 MORELLINO DI SCANSANO Heba Fattoria di Magliano,15.95,Graziana Grassini is the oenologist for Sassicaia but also here at Fattoria di Magliano and has been making the wine since their first harvest back in 2001. Heba is a beautiful 'Morellino di Scansano' the local name for the Sangiovese grape. It is loaded with bright red berries and gently spiced plum fruit. Nicely plush upfront, good weight - with notes of wild herbs and gorgeous lift and flow. This is made entirely in concrete with no oak at all - and this helps keep that bounce and pep. A delicious, easy and joyful wine 
2018 BOURGOGNE ROUGE 'Escargot' Damien Martin,15.95,This has a lovely deep centre of raspberry, cherry and damson and a brisk, crispness that makes it incredibly refreshing. One for pot roast partridge or grouse.
2018 TROS DE MAS VILELLA Mas Vilella,15.95,The latest inovation from the tireless Albert-Jané of Acustic Celler fame, is this brilliant, attractive and deeply satisfying red from his home farm - Mas Vilella. The Tros de Mas Vilella comes from the old vineyards planted around the family house by Albert's parents. The soils here are extremely poor and rocky with very low yields of just 15-20 hl/ha. Giving deep and flavoursome juice but underpinned with the tell-tale bright acidity of the native Sumoll (50%). Cabernet Sauvignon makes up the balance here and the results are sublime. Proper wine it is hard to resist drinking! There is something for everyone here. Juicy, deep and long - but above all full of joy. Well done Albert. 
2015 MINERVOIS 'Clos de Causses' La Livinière Guy Vanlancker,15.95,These wines are so of their place, with a distinct perfume of Mediterranean herbs and smoky barbecued meats. This is a rich red, made from Grenache and Syrah, but it never feels heavy and overdone. Savoury, herbal with plum, strawberry, blackberry and ground black pepper. Ripe full tannins are balanced by a lovely fresh acidity, so the feel in the mouth is persistent and super drinkable. Match this to a roast leg of lamb, sirloin of beef, venison or long slow cooked pork joint.
2014 RIOJA RESERVA Bodegas Ruconia,15.95,Intense, dark, red cherry colour. Strong aromas of tobacco, toasty notes, creamy and ripe blackberry aromas. Round, velvety and full of volume, leaving toasted, spicy notes on the palate.
2017 IL LABIRINTO Poggerino,16.5,Fresh red fruits, cherry, raspberry, crisp, with grip and tension, dark fleshy fruit core, quite serious.
2019 CHINON Les Granges Domaine Bernard Baudry,16.5,Les Granges is a fruity, agreeable wine that should be drunk young. It is an example of easy-going and round Chinon from sandy gravelly soil.
2014 CHÂTEAU L'ARGENTEYRE Cru Bourgeois Médoc,15.95,Deep colour, full and succulent, stays fresh and with supple mid-palate weight and a fine, direct Médoc character. Refined, but not lacking spice and vigour, this is another excellent Médoc from the Philippe and Gilles Reich, who also make the popular Château Aimée.
2016 PEZENAS ROUGE La Deves Domaine des Trinités,16.95,Carignan 90% Grenache Noir 10% The old vine Carignan here delivers bags of bramble and spice. This is a classic Languedoc wine, but in a very refined style. Great nose, transports you for a moment to an empty french church with incense and then gorgeous floaty black fruits. The palate has that floral hit too - but there is also a whiff of grilled meat and pure, dark-berried fruit - plus a garriguey herb mix. Delicious and serious feel - not tough, not grippy - just nicely lithe and with good push. Well done! This 2016 is now 'a point'. 
2017 TERRAZAS DE SERAPIA Garnacha Màquina y Tabla,16.5,From 70 to 80 year-old bush vines - grown high up at over 1000m on old sandy soil in mountains to the west of Madrid. As ever with Oriol and Susanna's wines, grown organically. A delightful full but airy Garnacha, red cherry and crunchy fruits, with dark chocolate notes and a mineral finish. A joy. 
2017 LADERAS DE LEONILA Mencia Màquina y Tabla,16.95,Another totally uplifting wine from Oriol, this is beautifully scented with damson and rhubard notes, scrubby herbs and spice. Lithe and sleek with a gorgeous balance of fresh acid and tender ripe tannins, another immensely drinkable wine.
2018 CHÂTEAU LA PERVENCHE Lalande de Pomerol,15.95,Chateau La Pervenche is arguably a more romantic name than the translation into English - it is hard to know how seriously people would take Chateau Blue Periwinkle - but this is a super Bordeaux bargain. Although quite modern in style this fabulous Lalande de Pomerol has a classy poise.
2018 RÉGNIÉ Cuvée des Braves Domaine Rochette,16.95,This is the top wine from the Rochette family's Regnie vineyards and on the 'Braves' hill. Their vines here are over 50 years old. The juice is so gorgeous, intense yet with such a supple red fruit character. Graceful, poised and flowing beautifully. This is serious Beaujolais for lovers of fine lines in their wines.
2014 CHÂTEAU GOUBAU La Source Côtes de Castillon,15.95,NaN
2019 ROSSO DI MONTEPULCIANO Cantine Dei,16.95,Always a charmer the 2019 is distinctly lovely. Quite plush plum and blackberry fruit nose with a gentle touch of hedgerow and wood spice. Sleek delivery, with barely-there, ripe tannins, a decadent ripeness and good length. This has a gracious ease and is delightful.
2018 BOURGUEIL Cote 50 Domaine Yannick Amirault,16.95,From sand and gravel soils this pure Cabernet Franc is the main production of the domaine. The cuvée used to be called 'La Coudraye', but the name change reflects the fact that La coudraye is only one of five parcels on the same slope. Crunchy with red berries and peppy red juice but there is a sheen of lovely polished black fruit too, lifted by spice and and fine grained mineral texture. Sleek and fresh Cabernet Franc. The Amiraults have been working organically for 15 years now and this great wine is a selection of the same plots.
2017 ACÚSTIC Vinyes Velles Nobles Acústic Celler,16.95,60% Samsó (Carignan) + 40% Garnatxa (Garnacha) from 35 to 65 year old vines; 10 months in 1 and 2 year old barriques. The results here are impressive. This deep, richly satisfying red hits all the marks you dream of with wines from big name villages in the Southern Rhone - but adds sleek charm and incredible spice too. Old vines, farmed organically and sensitively handled by Albert, with just a gentle seasoning from the old french barriques used. As Albert says - 'A good barrel is a barrel you cannot taste!'
2016 CHÂTEAU MARJOSSE Bordeaux,16.95,Elegant nose with notes of very ripe cherries, blueberries and blackberries with a hind of licorice. Fat and velvety on the palate with ripe tannins and a fruit compote finish. Blend: 80% merlot, 15% cabernet franc, 7% cabernet sauvignon, 3% malbec Average age of the vines: 20 years Soil: clay and limestone Ageing: in oak barrels (50% new) for 12 months Density: 5.000 vines/hectare Yield: 58 hl/ha
2018 LAMBRUSCO I Calanchi Monte delle Vigne,16.95,In comparison with the Classico this has more sinew and is a little firmer fruited. A more direct line of less juicy fruit. This is all round a more serious, cerebral style from Signor Ferrari. It is the purity and the lovely line of minerality that give a particular sense of structure here - a deep and intense dark fruit underlies this but there is a savoury edge too a hint of coffee grains and some blueberry and mulberry undertones. All of this is gently highlighted by the relatively low level of residual sugar at just 7g/l. Fascinating and more brooding, this is serious stuff!
2018 MORGON Côte de Py Domaine Rochette,16.95,A wilder darker fruit nose, rich with plum, violets, chocolate, cherries and blackberries. Tang and lift almost a citrus undernote, richly embued with black cherry and blackberry fruit, power and intensity, sleek, mouthwatering, impressive, this is superb.
2016 L'ATZAR Celler Mas La Mola,17.5,A serious Cabernet Sauvignon, Carignan, Syrah, Garnacha, Merlot blend from the Spanish wine region of Priorat. This small wine region within Catalunya in north east Spain, is known for its full-bodied and complex red wines of outstanding quality, and holds Spain’s top accolade of DOC A status. Rich complex wine filled with dark berry fruit, and well integrated but rich tannins. 
2015 CHÂTEAU GOUBAU La Source Côtes de Castillon,16.95,The second wine of Chateau Goubau comes from the vineyard parcels facing south and south-west on the slopes bordering the domain's natural source. Made from a blend of 95% Merlot grapes and 5% Cabernet Franc grapes, the wine is spicy and fresh with aromas of red fruits, plums and spice. On the palate the wine is crunchy and fruity with black fruit flavours and a touch of spice; the finish is lively and appealing. Drink now for next three years.
2018 SAINT NICOLAS DE BOURGUEIL La Source Domaine Yannick Amirault,17.95,We actually visited the Amirault on a busy day during the 2018 harvest. Basket after basket of perfect grapes came in and tasting this you can sense that bountiful, beautiful harvest. Benoit Amirault who oversees the winemaking now, with his father Yannick, has an allergy to Sulphur so they use only the bare minimum here in the cellar. Just one reason why you really feel the pert perfection of the fruit in this gorgeous, sleek and deeply inviting Cabernet Franc. Like the Bourgueil ‘Cote 50’, this is bright and juicy, floral on the nose, red fruit and fresh tonic acidity giving a full and lively, slightly peppery palate.
2018 LA MAGGIORINA Le Piane,17.5,Made from the oldest vines on the estate, this Nebbiolo/Croatina blend is lighter in colour than the estate's other wines. Pepper and spice on the nose with a hint of oak. Bright fruits with fresh acidity and again a touch of spice on the palate, this would be wonderful with a plate of salami. 
2018 BARBERA D'ALBA Andrea Oberto,17.95,NaN
2019 FLEURIE Clos de La Roilette,17.95,Bottled only a week before I tasted it, Alain Coudert's 2019 Fleurie from the Clos de la Roilette is showing beautifully, wafting from the glass with aromas of rose petals, red cherries, raspberries, spices and orange rind. Medium to full-bodied, deep and velvety, it's elegant and fine-boned, with lively acids, refined structuring tannins and a long, perfumed finish. Readers who gravitate toward classical styles of Beaujolais will prefer the 2019 to the richer, more gourmand 2018, but both are lovely vintages for this reference-point address. 
2019 DOLCETTO DI DIANO D'ALBA Bricco Maiolica,17.5,NaN
2018 BARBERA D'ALBA Bricco Maiolica,17.5,NaN
2013 ESTATE RESERVE Glenelly Estate,17.5,This is the second tier red from Glenelly, made from Syrah blended with a mix of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Elegant, focused style, black fruit with clarrty cigar both as well as good dense sweet black fruit.
2015 CABURNIO Tenuta Monteti,17.95,Concentrated forest-fruit nose with a hint of fruit cake. Just a touch medicinal at first and then supple fruit of great depth. The gritty, firm tannins on the finish are a little demanding right now. 
2017 AMANCAYA Bodegas Caro,17.5,At once ripe with plenty of cassis, blackberry and blueberry, but also delicate herbal notes, this has a rather complex and delicate nose. Quite a sleek, elegant wine for Mendoza with fine tannins and nice freshness, carrying the long, focused finish. A blend of 83 per cent cabernet sauvignon and 17 per cent malbec. Drink or hold.
2018 CAIRANNE Côtes du Rhône Villages Domaine Romain Roche,18.5,NaN
2018 CHINON Domaine Bernard Baudry,18.5,Light purplish red. Warm vintage. Garden aromas of tomato, flower stem and olive. In the mouth, lower acidity and swirling minerality at midpalate. The thrill rises toward a fresh finish full of stoniness. Thirteen months in cement tank.
2014 CHÂTEAU PERRON Lalande de Pomerol,18.5,With the 2014 there is a touch more crunch and crispness to the acidity and tannins. When you add that to Perron's normal supple polished black fruits, you get a wine that has everything in great balance. Undercut with a touch of leaf tea and gentle mint and dark chocolate.
2017 PELORO Rosso Le Casematte,17.95,70% Nerello Mascalese. 30% Nocera aged in 1st and 2nd year use French Oak Tonneaux for 6 months. Gorgeously aromatic, pepper, violets, herbs and cherry skins, blackberry and raspberry, really generous. The palate has tang and grip, juicy fruit, cherry, cranberry and blackberry. Rich tannins, bright sappy acid, then herbs come through on the finish with a touch of pepper.
2016 CHÂTEAU D'AURILHAC Cru Bourgeois Médoc,18.5,Quite intense and juicy with some red pimento powder aroma. Lots of breadth and fun even if far from the most concentrated on the palate. Racy.
2016 LA VIOLETTE DU MANOIR Côtes de Castillon Château Manoir du Gravoux,18.95,This is another great effort from Francois Thienpont. It comes eclusively from a 2 Hectare plot that the family rent on a very long-term basis. The vines were planted in 1958 and that old vine intensity is clear. Although this is mostly Merlot - the 8% of Cabernet Franc stands proud. A beguiling nose leads to a gorgeously svelte palate layered with spiced plum - well-baked, dark fruits lifted with cinnamon and cloves - some fresher black cherry flesh adds a perk and gentle brightness.Deliciously sophisticated and really sleek 'right-bank' claret. Yes.
2016 LA RAISON D’HÊTRE Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,17.95,The second wine of L’Hêtre, a new wine in the distinctly up-and-coming AP of Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux. Owned by the Thienpont family, organically farmed and situated high on the limestone plateau to the east of St-Emilion, this is great value considering its pedigree. 95% Merlot with a dash of Cabernet Franc, there is dark blackcurrant fruit and a whiff of smoke, allied to ripe tannins and potential to age.
2017 CABERNET SAUVIGNON Grande Reserve Los Vascos,18.95,The colour is an intense ruby, with aromas of black cherry, cassis, vanilla, tobacco, cinnamon, cedar and spices. Later, the nose develops into ripe black fruit such as mulberry and cherry with a note of blackcurrant. In the mouth, it is rich, round and fleshy. The tannins are silky and elegant and the wine has impressive length with a pleasant peppery and liquorice finish.
2017 XÉRICO Tentenublo,19.5,Deeper colour than the 'Tinto', a raw freshness, a hint of reduction, super-taut black fruit and sappy energy from whole bunch fermentation. It's 'sauvage' energy is captivating from now and becomes more so with a little aeration.
2017 MOFETE ETNA ROSSO Palmento Costanzo,19.5,NaN
2019 ANJOU ROUGE Sur La Butte Château de Plaisance,NaN,We could hardly contain ourselves when we first tasted this sumptuous, pretty and delicately perfumed red. The perfect balance between ornate high-toned complexity and delightfully pleasing, soft red-fruit flesh is perfect. At once indulgent and then thought provoking. Wine it is hard to stop going back to. Polished and sleek on the palate, but without ever losing the delicate patina of elegant detail. An exciting addition from this under the radar zone for red wine. This is one to watch!
2017 CHÂTEAU MONTAIGUILLON Montagne Saint Emilion,19.5,NaN
2018 CHIANTI CLASSICO Poggerino,19.5,NaN
2016 CHÂTEAU PERRON Lalande de Pomerol,19.5,NaN
2015 CHIANTI CLASSICO Le Fioraie Piemaggio,19.95,We really are in a sweet spot with Tuscan releases at the moment and this is the first of two consecutive vintages of simply cracking wines. The 2015 is slightly more muscular and powerful, plenty of rich berry and damson fruit, ripe mouthfilling tannins, earthy, savoury and with a nice undercut of acid. This is quite boisterous at present, but that is no bad thing as it will provide incredibly characterful drinking with rich meat dishes.
2019 CROZES HERMITAGE Cuvée Papillon Domaine Gilles Robin,20.5,NaN
2014 CHÂTEAU LA PEYRE Saint Estèphe,19.95,The slightly unexciting label disguises a wine with real Saint Estèphe character - the huge 'R' presumably for the owner René. A firm nose of pencil lead and a touch of cigar-box, and a firm fruit that seems to tell of authoritative Cabernet, this is dryly sophisticated, a 'grown-up' wine which is so much more than fruit. Quite concentrated, intense, dark and long.
2016 GRAN AUTÒCTON Vinyes Velles Autòcton Celler,20.95,A sublime wine from the incredibly talented Albert Jane Ubeda. Here Albert has resurrected an indigenous and much maligned variety, Sumoll and given it some real love and affection. Fermented and aged in a mixture of barrique and amphorae, this bright, fresh, pure red has notes of cherry, raspberry and strawberry. There is some lovely complexity of spice and hedgrow fragrance with a sappy lively acidity. This is a compelling red that entices you back for another sip, great with meaty fish, game, even pluma of pork if you are pushing the boat out.
2017 KLEOS Aglianico Luigi Maffini,19.95,Luigi continues to knock it out of the park with his wines, endlessly refining and evolving the way he works and the results are superb. This is pure Aglianico, but unlike the ones from further north, soils are sedimentary rather than Volcanic and as a result you get a very different wine. Supple and aromatic this has blueberry, damson and blackberry fruit, there are touches of dark chocolate, herbs and a dark spiciness. In the mouth the wine is sleek and mobile, black fruits once more with some fleshy pluminess, chocolate, spice and herb flecked, it is an absolute joy now and over the next 5 years or so.
2019 LANGHE NEBBIOLO Barale Fratelli,20.75,A lovely supple succulent feel to this wine, floral roses and cherry, damson fruit underpinned by a delicate earthiness. This is sleek in the mouth with pliable tannins surrounding a lively red fruit core. Balanced and poised it is a lot of fun.
2016 CHÂTEAU DU CÈDRE Cahors Pascal Verhaeghe,20.95,95% Malbec and 5% Merlot. 20% aged in French oak barrels for 16 Months. One of the new classics of the appellation, Pascal Verhaeghe's flagship is modern in style, full of well-defined black fruit and velvet tannins - retaining a bright freshness which makes it very drinkable.
2019 LANGHE NEBBIOLO Andrea Oberto,20.95,NaN
2015 CHÂTEAU SÉNÉJAC Cru Bourgeois Supérieur Haut Médoc,20.5,Quite a ripe, 'autumn raspberry' sort of fruit on the nose, ripe in the middle, retaining freshness, middle weight, quite harmonious. Not massive but pretty, and with decent length, will probably be rather silky and delicious like the 2012.
2017 L'O DE LA VIE Minervois Domaine Anne Gros et Jean-Paul Tollot,20.75,Lovely fragrant Grenache led nose, strawberries, plums and raspberry fruit. On the palate you get the thicker structure of the Syrah, underpinning the fresh fruit. Plum, blackberry and raspberry, some lovely herbal back notes, a touch of dug earth and then some spice on the long finish.
2017 PINOT NOIR Tributary Two Rivers of Marlborough,21.25,Dave Clouston's Pinots are always a delight to drink and this fragrant beauty is no different. Opening up with a lovely intensity of rhubarb, cherry and raspberry fruits, there are notes of spice and just a hint of something floral. Mouthfilling and yet surprisingly refreshing in equal parts, that red fruit core is there again, with a note of mocha, spice and undergrowth. This would drink so well with either partridge or pheasant.
2016 CHÂTEAU DOYAC Cru Bourgeois Haut Médoc,20.95,Intense black fruit with a touch of bitterness on the palate, and simple spices that prevent this being too one-dimensional
2018 LIRAC La Dame Rousse Domaine de la Mordorée,20.95,Mordorée is a world-renowned Southern Rhône estate specialising in Tavel Rosé, Liracs, Châteauneuf- du-Pape and a marvellous Côtes-du- Rhône, and all of these wines can be found at L&S. Every wine here is a beauty and this Lirac combines both a staggeringly beautiful palate and also a surprisingly affordable price. It is also drinking wonderfully now, so you can crack on today and be assured of a highly- polished, deeply fruited and accurately spiced red wine. It is heady, indulgent and also finely detailed and you simply must taste it.
2017 CHIANTI CLASSICO Castagnoli,20.95,A very refined and delicious Chianti - bright cherry and raspberry fruit which had depth and dark fruit and spicy polished wood notes too. Good acidity makes this instantly juicy and sappy and supple-textured. Very refined and long.
2019 CHÂTEAU DU CÈDRE Extra Libre Cahors Pascal Verhaeghe,20.95,Made without added sulphur, Cahors Extra Libre became possible only after years of preparation in the vineyards. Black in colour. Wild berries, spices and a hint of violets - despite the dark expression it is lifted and bright, finishing on cedary notes - very much Cahors in profile.
2011 CHÂTEAU PUYGUERAUD Côtes de Francs,20.95,From the Nicolas Thienpont family of estates (which includes Pavie Macquin and Larcis Ducasse) the Puygueraud is juicy and intense with ripe fruit exploding on the nose and a generous palate of cassis and black cherry. A great, open, crowd-pleasing style of claret that would tackle roast pork with some aplomb. Clever balance hear of mature sophistication and just enough generosity of fruit. Delicious. 75% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Franc, 5% Malbec.
2016 CROZES HERMITAGE Cuvée Ghany Domaine Gaylord Machon,21.95,Great aromatics from the start on the Cuvee Ghany, cracked black pepper, dark cherry and plum fruit. The palate is richly textured with fleshy plum fruit, some lovely cooked meat notes, undergrowth and black pepper spice on the finish. Ready to drink from the off, but with plenty to keep it going for a good few years.
2018 BILBO Saint Saturnin Domaine de La Réserve d'O,21.5,From vineyards high above the village of Arboras, where the heat of the Mediterranean meets the cooler heights of the Plateau de Larzac. Mostly Grenache (with some Cinsault and just a touch of Syrah), unwooded but left to 'age' for 6 months in a concrete tank. All the ripeness and intensity of fruit you would expect to find in a Languedoc red, warm spices even, but balanced with a refreshing lift. Organic. 
2018 CHINON Les Grézeaux Domaine Bernard Baudry,21.95,Les Grézeaux is concentrated, its body is dense yet silky, thanks to the gravels in its soil. It can age 10 years, and a lot longer in good vintages.
2018 BARBERA D'ALBA Serraboella Cigliuti,21.95,Claudia takes the fruit for this wine solely from the Cru of Serraboella and as a result tends to allow the fruit to sing without too much encumbrance of oak. This is because Serraboella is a special site, sloping down in front of the family property, the Cigliuti's were the first to name the vineyard on their bottles in 1978. Beautifully fragrant and intense with black cherry, blackberry and violets on the nose. In the mouth the wine is generous, with a deep draft of black fruit, but has a fine acid line and chiselled rich tannins, that give lovely structure and definition in the mouth. A joy to drink now but these are fine wines which can age for years too.
2017 CHÂTEAU LAROQUE Margaux,21.5,65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot. A six-hectare property owned by Éric Léglise, who also owns Château le Coteau. You might think that you don't what to drink anything as young as a 2017, but it would be a mistake, because this wine is open, generous, aromatic, spicy and with a lovely fine-grained, velvet-tannined dry appeal which makes it seem much more mature than its years, despite the youthful vigour. It really has the class of Margaux wines that are much more expensive.
2015 SHIRAZ Sunbury The Hairy Arm,22.5,This is a fresher iteration of the Aussie style, still with lovely mouthfilling fruitiness, plums and blackberries, but more supple, pliant and textured. A delicious medium weight, berry filled delight that will please those after a less full throttle experience.
2016 ZINFANDEL Cemetery Vineyard m2 Wines,22.95,Layne's local customers were getting confused by the name of his 'emtwopointone' so from this vintage onwards his 'everyday Zin' will be named after the vineyard it has always come from instead - Cemetary Vineyard. The wine is completely enthralling again. Deep and richly fruited. there's cinnamon and sweet tobacco balanced by delicious cherry fruit and plum. Yet again it is the drive and line that he conjures up in these Lodi gems that are so impressive. This is a beautiful heady wine - but for people who don't necessarily want big wines. Neatly done and this comes from the super vineyard Layne works so meticulously.
2017 MOURVÈDRE Michael Klouda Wines,22.95,We first met Michael as he released his 2014 Mourvedre which was a complete humdinger and soon became a huge favourite for lovers of Rhone style wines - but also wines with depth and spice and juicy lift. Three years on from his first effort at Mourvedre, this 2017 is brimming with his signature 'lightness of touch'. There is some good dusty grip in the middle and then the lovely well sculpted dark fruit builds - there is a rare brightness to the palate too which distinguishes it from many wines from Lodi - another joyous release from this exciting talent.
2017 CARIGNANE Michael Klouda Wines,22.95,This wine is an absolute joy from first sniff to final sip. Very much on the red fruit spectrum with cherry, mulberry and strawberry fruit concentration. It is deliciously open in style with a bright juicy acidity, plenty of rich red fruits on the palate with just a hint of maceration and then a whiff of something wild and scrubby.
2019 SANCERRE Chavignol Rouge Domaine Vincent Delaporte,22.95,The beautiful deep ruby-violet colours of this pinot noir wine give way to aromas of very ripe red fruits (cherry, blackberry and raspberry). The nose is intense and wellintegrated, with odours of cooked red fruits and roasted coffee beans. There are also hints of graphite and cinnamon. Very round and smooth on the attack, with tight tannins on the palate. In the mouth come aromas of smoke and prune. This wine is ready to drink, but could also be kept for some years. 
2014 CHÂTEAU GOUBAU Côtes de Castillon,22.5,This wine comes from vineyards planted at the tip of the limestone plateau which stretches west to Saint-Emilion. These are the best parcels of the estate situated on the outskirts of the village of Saint-Philippe-d'Aiguille with subsoils of clay and limestone. Made from a blend of 95% Merlot grapes and 5% Cabernet Franc grapes, the wine is characterised by a mineral freshness in the nose which gives way to aromas of autumn fruits, good oak flavours and spice. On the palate, there is good tannic structure with attractive intensity and a persistent finish.
2016 CABERNET SAUVIGNON Dark Pearl Fleurieu Salomon Estate,23.5,This is a little weedy, yet the cabernet delivers nice, fresh fruit and citrus undertones. Full body, but not too exaggerated with tannins. Drink now. Screw cap.
2018 LA DULA Garnacha de Altura Sierra de Toloño,23.5,The fruit for this small cuvée comes from several small plots whose old vines of Garnacha and Garnacha Gris average 80 years old. The vineyards are all very high too at 700m. This gives the juice an intensity and also an incredible purity. This truly is a mountain wine. Fermented in small barrels and then aged in amphora to round out the fruit without adding any oak notes - this is all about pure fruit expression. A total joy to taste. Bright red fruits - floral too and so refined. As Tim Atkin notes when crowning this his 'Red Wine Discovery' of the year - this calls to mind a Pinot-like feel and elegance. Sophisticated stuff.
2018 FIRST FLIGHT Syrah Domaine G&J Bott,23.5,Pure Syrah from high up vines in Seyssual. Bright cherry fruit, touch of pepper with zipping redcurrant and deeper blackberry notes. This really impresses for the lovely purity and tidy precision. Focused, fresh and full of joy. Huge quality at this price level.
2018 BARBERA D'ALBA Campass Cigliuti,23.5,NaN
2018 CAIRANNE La Bousquette Côtes du Rhône Villages Domaine Romain Roche,23.95,85% Grenache and 15% Carignan, all hand-harvested, from 100 year old vines. On red clay at the bottom, with limestone in the upper part. The varieties are planted mixed together in the vineyard and Romain picks them together and co-ferments them. Rich old-vine fruit with real density and chew, this is Romain's one wine which would benefit from keeping for a year or two before starting it.
2019 BARDA PINOT NOIR Bodega Chacra,23.95,Piero's 'village' wine is an absolute beauty. Elegant red fruits and a sublime, more mineral - almost saline note make this glide across your palate in graceful and pretty way. There is a real sense of finesse, perfectly balanced earthy notes vie with the softly pert fruit. <br> The wines are farmed bio-dynamically and Piero is intent to minimise his impact on the environment while maximising the expression of this sensational and special place. This goes beyond the thoughtful and respectful winemaking and into the restrained packaging too. He has stopped using any sort of capsule over the cork - and the bottles are a long way from the showy, heavy bottles we have come to despair of too - this minimises the weight and reduces the impact of shipping this great bottle to your door. There are only upsides to this care and attention: super wine to drink and minimal impact for the planet. <br> Put this up against almost any 'village' wine from Burgundy and it will more than surprise you. Serious wine making, fun wine drinking.
2018 PIESPORTER GÜNTERSLAY Pinot Noir Trocken Qba Weingut Lehnert-Veit,23.95,You always get good grunt with the Pinots from Lehnert Veit and this is no different. Pungent and slightly animal with distinct damson and cranberry fruit on the nose, with just an undercut of dusty spice. In the mouth the wines have delicious volume, sleek, deeply fruited, dark cherry, damson and black raspberry. Nice texture from the tannins and a freshness from bright acid, savoury and satisfying, with some darker notes and spice on the finish. 
2015 CHÂTEAU DE MALLERET Cru Bourgeois Haut Médoc,24.5,As soon as you put your nose in the glass - you can sense the class of this polished beauty. The fruit is dark and quite serious. There are lovely notes of damson and baked plums. This classic core is lifted and softened by some sweeter, riper black-fleshed berries. There are lovely baking-spice notes, some meaty wafts too - a generous, perfectly proportioned Claret that is generous enough to suit all palates. Such a sleek, polished flow leaves this the perfect bottle for drinking on a chilly evening.
2018 BOLGHERI ROSSO Le Macchiole,24.75,(Merlot 40%, Cabernet Franc 20%, Cabernet Sauvignon 20%, Syrah 20%). Fermentation and maceration for about 15 days in steel tanks. Then aged for 10 months, 80% in oak barriques (2nd, 3rd and 4th use) and the other 20% in concrete.
2017 FARO Rosso DOC Le Casematte,24.5,This delicious red is made from 55% Nerello Mascalese, 25% Nerello Capuccio, 10% Nocera and Nero d'Avola aged for 18 months in older French oak tonneaux. Sleekly aromatic nose, cherries, raspberries, mocha, herbs and wild flowers. Good acid lift, rich core of tannins, lots of ripe fleshy red fruits, cherries, macerated strawberries and mocha. Not heavy at all but persistent and with great length.
2018 VACQUEYRAS Domaine la Bouïssière,24.5,NaN
2018 HANNIBAL Bouchard Finlayson,23.5,Supple dried cherry, blackberry and savoury meat burst underpinned by a tobacco and green olive core. An appealing mid-palate grip is counter-balanced by refreshing acidity – hinting that patience will be greatly rewarded. Complex and long. Drink now through 2028.
2017 TOURIGA NACIONAL Quinta da Romaneira,24.95,Quinta da Romaneira continues to go from strength to strength under the stewardship of Christian Seely and the 2017 Touriga Nacional is another cracker. Fragrant cherry, violets and dark chocolate on the nose, in the mouth it is rich and concentrated with silky black fruits, that floral back note and then chocolate and a hint of underbrush.
2015 COLÉCCION Cuvelier los Andes,24.95,70% Malbec ; 13% Syrah, 10% Petit Verdot ; 7% Cabernet Sauvignon Aging: 60% in French oak barrels for 12 months. Appearance: red with ruby reflections and a very nice intensity. Aroma: complex, intense and seductive with notes of red fruit, spice and marmalade. Mouth: very soft, silky, velvety and intense. A very good wine
2017 VINO NOBILE DI MONTEPULCIANO Cantine Dei,24.95,NaN
2019 LANGHE NEBBIOLO Cigliuti,24.95,Charles Lea was horrified when I asked to taste this – “It’s so young, it’ll be – “ he squeaked and did one of his full-body horrified tasting notes. It IS young but 2019 seems to be a generous vintage and this nebbiolo is also fruity and wonderfully perfumed. I liked it; Charles liked it.
2015 PETIT VERDOT Quinta da Romaneira,25.95,From the most beautiful estate you can possibly imagine, run by Quinta da Noval’s Christian Seely comes this superbly refined pure Petit Verdot. Tea, tobacco, mint, dark cherry and cassis, elegant and precise. Sleek and mobile in the mouth, darkly fleshy, but with poise and grip, tobacco, mocha and black fruit to the fore once more. As with all the wines from these steep slopes that run down to the Douro river – you can really sense the place when you taste. Undergrowth and wild herbs add to the perfumed whole. Delicious.
2015 CROZES HERMITAGE Cuvée Lhony Domaine Gaylord Machon,25.95,Made from Gaylord's older vines (thirty year old in 2015), this upper cuvée is produced from lower yields of 35hl/ha, and is all aged in wood - large 'demi-muid' barrels, some new, some which have had one wine in previously. A fuller, richer wine than its brother Cuvée Ghany, it is still in the same supple, elegant style with excellent juice and definition.
2018 ESTATE PINOT NOIR Illahe Vineyards,25.95,A brilliant new addition to our American range, we have been looking for an Oregon Pinot for quite some time and as soon as we tasted this we knew we had to have it. Deliciously fragrant with cherry, wild strawberry, just a hint of cinnamon spice, mocha and wild rose. Textured and supple in the mouth, there is plenty of rich red fruit, sleek ripe tannin and a vivacious acid lift with a gentle, almost chocolate feel to the finish.
2017 NICASIA RED Tinta de Toro Màquina y Tabla,25.5,Another bold and beautiful red from Oriol, this is wonderfully fragrant, bramble, macerated cherries, pepper, spice and notes of tarragon and leather. In the mouth you think this is going to be full on, but it is actually gorgeously lithe, ripe acid underpinning, spiced plums and cherries. The finish has plenty of macerated fruit, aniseed, a little something savoury and balsamic, but never heavy, finishing gently spicy and herbal, superb, incredibly characterful drinking, well done.
2016 BRAO Vinyes Velles Nobles Acústic Celler,25.95,Another sublime wine from Albert Jané, old vine blend of Garnacha and Carinena aged in french oak barrels of varying sizes. This is explosively fruity, with plum, blackberry, rosemary and earthy mocha notes. It fills the mouth with layered black fruit, herbs, liquorice and dark chocolate. Rich full tannins, beautiful acid lift and then a bold drive giving length and tension to the finish.
2016 OLD VINE ZINFANDEL Dry Soucie Vineyard m2 Wines 'Centenary Edition',25.95,Layne Montgomery is a charming, colourful character and a very talented winemaker. He sources the grapes for this top cuvée from the historic Soucie vineyard. Here he works 3 acres of the vines (half the vineyard) on the coolest, most eastern flank of the Lodi wine region. The vines here are ungrafted and untrained and have been producing top quality Zinfandel since they were planted a hundred years ago in 1916. This is a superb example of Californian Zinfandel - and shows the best of what can be done here with ancient vines and beautifully intense fruit. This is quite full on, a lovely intense, ripe dark fruit gives a plush, flesh to the middle and then the pepper and a lovely undergrowthy spice kicks in and tightens things up a bit. Only 25% of this spends time in new American Oak, which is all that it needs to maintain that bright, broad dark fruit character but stops well short of being too plump - a real gem.
2014 CHÂTEAU PETIT BOCQ Saint Estèphe,25.95,Dark and purple colour tells of the high Cabernet content and hints at the concentrated style. But just when you think this is going to have a touch of Saint Estèphe severity, it is instead all aromatic and almost floral. On the palate the terroir asserts itself - this is 'grown-up' and the classical cedary and cassis are absolutely there - but still rounded, flattering, just enough to make it classy and long. The nose remains joyously heady and succulent and keeps you coming back for more. Great value and another example of the success of the top of the Médoc in 2014.
2012 CHÂTEAU TOUR DE LAROZE Margaux,25.95,From the same team as Château Labégorce, and a steal at this price. An open and aromatic nose lifts at once from the glass and persists. The palate is silky, mid-weight, gentle, insinuating more than imposing, again showing and open aromatic fruit and spice profile, and finishes long and harmonious. In terms of tasting like the textbook definition of classic Margaux style it is hard to fault, and it has charm too. A lovely wine at entering its peak of drinkability now.
2018 CROZES HERMITAGE Cuvée Albéric Bouvet Domaine Gilles Robin,26.5,NaN
2014 CHÂTEAU LILIAN LADOUYS Cru Bourgeois Supérieur Saint Estèphe,25.95,The upswing in fortunes and class of this great little estate are crystal-clear, since the since its acquisition and serious investment by French property magnate Jacky Lorenzetti. In this 2014 release, the 2% Petit Verdot adds another dimension to this ample, full and satisfying claret. There is a touch of chewy intensity to the deep fruit - but the level of ripeness is spot-on. Broad, yes but a measured balance is there too. Nicely done with a touch of modernity. Another stylish St Estephe! This is drinking brilliantly now, but will comfortably rest in the cellar for mid-term drinking.
2007 CHÂTEAU DE CÉRONS Cérons,26.5,Caroline Perromat describes this as 
2017 CHINON Clos Guillot Domaine Bernard Baudry,26.95,From one of Baudry’s top limestone sites. Aged 12 months in 2- to 5-year-old barrels, then rests for nine months in cement tanks. Still young and rambunctious, very juicy and full of energy, very like Pinot-like. It’s one of the fruitier Baudry expressions, with lots of black and sour cherry, some blackberry and tomato, and light stoniness on the finish. Give this a year or two and it will pay back your patience.
2015 LES COLOMBIERS DE FEYTIT CLINET Pomerol,26.95,Quite a bold wine with cinnamon spice on the nose and a plump fine-velvet cushiony feel and a warming spicy roundness - fine tannins that speak of the clay soils. Great entry, a little bit missing in the middle, but a rewarding back palate and the ripe warmth of the vintage in the throat. OK it's not perfect, but this is characterful and great value.
2018 MERCUREY Vieilles Vignes Domaine François Raquillet,27.5,The vines are now 65 years old. Good pretty and enticing nose. Pinot with a sense of weight and plush edge. Palate starts fresh and clean. Good mineral edge to the core, then a brightness - a red edge to the fruit. Silky touch. Gets better and better on the palate. Really rather delicious. Some warm spice on finish. 
2018 PINOT NOIR Bon Sauvage Willamette Valley Illahe Vineyards,27.5,NaN
2015 MOULIN À VENT Les Rouchaux Domaine Thibault Liger-Belair, Beaujolais,27.95,From deep soils and the bottom of the hill of Moulin à Vent. 30% whole bunch. Powerfully rich and structured to the point that it is difficult to identify it with 'Beaujolais' at all, but the richness is extremely impressive!
2015 TONGUE IN GROOVE Pinot Noir Cabal Vineyard,27.5,Ripe and attractive black-cherry and plum aromas with a neat thread of spicy and earthy, savory notes. Supple, fleshy and silky palate with juicy, ripe and spicy red-cherry flavors, finishing fresh and luscious. Drink or hold. Screw cap.
2018 GALPIN PEAK Pinot Noir Bouchard Finlayson,26.95,Vinification: A total of eight vineyards, each with a unique contribution to the wine’s complexity, are picked by hand and cooled overnight, before being destemmed. Following fermentation by certified organic yeasts, each parcel was pressed individually and transferred to French oak barrels. After eleven months maturation, the final blend was assembled in tank and bottled following four months of natural clarification. Tasting note: The wine exhibits the generous texture of the vintage, moderately rich yet supple. Intriguing perfumed dark cherry and wild berry, with espresso infused cinnamon spice adding to the appeal. Deftly balanced, it portrays elegance, but the tannins form neatly on a lengthy finish.
2017 VIGNA VIGIA Barbera d'Alba Superiore Bricco Maiolica,27.95,NaN
2017 IL CUMOT Nebbiolo d'Alba Superiore Bricco Maiolica,27.95,NaN
2019 MALBEC A Lisa Bodega Noemia,26.95,This is really creamy and delicious with sliced-plum and light earth aromas and flavors. Hints of redwood. Medium-bodied, firm and silky. Subtle and firm. Focused. Drink or hold.
2017 GIGONDAS Domaine la Bouïssière,27.95,Limpid ruby. Pungent red and dark berry and floral scents, along with suggestions of licorice, cola, olive and smoky minerals. Youthfully taut bitter cherry and black raspberry flavors show very good depth and a sharp, spicy jolt of cracked pepper on the back half. Fine-grained tannins build steadily on a long, penetrating finish that leaves dark chocolate and candied lavender notes behind.
2018 PINOT NOIR Herrenreben Domaine Schoenheitz,28.5,This has quite an earthy style, but also impressive depth and a ton of healthy tannins that make it come across a bit like a good Pommard. This is quite an imposing wine, but not a jot too ripe nor too oaky. With more depth at the polished finish it would rate even higher. Drink or hold.
2015 CHÂTEAU CAPBERN Saint Estèphe,27.95,A much more modern wine than anything produced when it was called Capbern Gasqueton. A big dense-fruit nose, a purple-fruit filled velvet punch, all very well-integrated. The front-end is incredibly impressive with all the dark berry fruit depth to the flavour. It takes its time to open up in the middle and finish. Very ripe, with a sophisticated élevage in barrel, this is a lot of wine for the money.
2018 LIRAC Rouge Cuvée de la Reine des Bois Domaine de la Mordorée,28.95,A blend of Syrah with Grenache and Mourvèdre from forty year old vines, aged in a combination of oak barrels and foudres and some stainless steel, this is the Delorme's super-cuvée of Lirac. Deep purple to black colour, this is always a muscular style, the Syrah getting the edge in the aromatics, while the Grenache fills out the palate and the Mourvèdre gives depth and length. Big fruit structure and rich tannins, nevertheless beautifully balanced and with a great future.
2016 RUBICON Meerlust,27.95,The 2016 Rubicon has an expressive nose of mulberry with subtle oak and red and brown spices. Comprised of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot, the full-bodied palate is still tight and structured with a grippy, chewy edge, but elegance can be gained with age and this wine ends well structured with focused balance.
2004 FONSECA GUIMARAENS Single Wooden Box with Decanting Funnel,27.95,The fresh, intoxicating blackberry fruit aromas are enhanced by a wonderfully aromatic, scented quality. A huge amount of depth and backbone to this finely tuned Port. Everything is in harmony and perfect balance. The dark berry fruit flavours marry exquisitely with the tannins, leaving the mouth aching for more. A very fine wine.
2018 PIESPORTER FALKENBERG Pinot Noir Trocken Qba Weingut Lehnert-Veit,28.95,NaN
2017 PLAER Priorat Ritme Celler,28.95,NaN
2015 CÔTE DE NUITS VILLAGES Terres Nobles Domaine de la Douaix,NaN,From two separate parcels with differing soils, each brings its own personality with a fresh fruitness undercut with some complexing oak and a certain earthiness. Lovely mouthful of dark cherry and raspberry fruit that is supported by a juicy acid and some delicious sappy tannins.
2015 TERRAZZE CHIANTI CLASSICO Riserva Castagnoli,29.5,Grown in very hard-to-manage narrow terraces on a precipitous slope, with each vine on a pole, so everything has to be done by hand. Undoubtedly hideously hard work but the result is one of the most complete and refined wines in Chianti, with a fullness and supple richness combined with a filigree grace and delicacy in the impressive length.
2017 MERCUREY 1er Cru Champs Martin Domaine Paul et Marie Jacqueson,29.75,Faces due south and so the bright and peppy attack is surprising at first - but then more weight and ripeness builds quite quickly. This is nicely done. An energy and bounce here that is more pronounced than with the other Reds tasted here. It flows on with great momentum and silky edged juice, impressively voluptuous but the juice is just piquant enough. Good measure. Strawberries and some plum meld together well - attractive and satisfying.
2013 RÉSERVE DE LÉOVILLE BARTON Saint Julien,28.95,NaN
2015 POGGIO BESTIALE Rosso della Maremma Fattoria di Magliano,29.95,'Proper 'super-Tuscan' style for a less than stratospheric super-Tuscan price. This gorgeous Bordeaux blend is aged for 18 months in new Alliers oak. Still a vibrant youthful colour; a fruity spicy nose with notes of cassis, blackberries and tobacco. The palate shows concentration, full-body and a dense tannin structure, a great line of acidity too, but already beautifully integrated. This is immediately charming, especially with a good dinner, or capable of ageing for another 5+ years.'
2014 CHÂTEAU LE THIL (Comte Clary) Pessac-Léognan,29.5,The 2014 Le Thil has turned out nicely. Sweet red cherry, flowers, mint and pipe tobacco give the wine its distinctive aromatic signatures, while silky tannins add to an overall impression of grace and creaminess.
2017 ROSSO DI MONTALCINO Ginestreto Fuligni,29.95,Fuligni makes very evocative wines. In this, a rich tapestry of flavours from old saddle leather to red and black cherries and dusts recalls Tuscany with every sip. You don’t need to bring in the rib of beef to enjoy it; a glass of this will make a feast of a bowl of pasta.
2018 CHIANTI CLASSICO Nuovo Poggerino,30.5,NaN
2013 CHIANTI CLASSICO Le Fioraie Riserva Piemaggio,30.95,Another cracker from Michele Neri, this is Sangiovese with real punch and power. From Castellina so it displays quite a chiselled frame. Rich earthy, dark fruit core, a touch balsamic, spice and minty aniseed. Bold and full flavoured, meaty, dark cherry and plum, mouthfilling shapely tannins, lovely ripe acid lift and a delicious savoury rip on the finish.
2017 ONE BLOCK 'Yellingbo' Yarra Valley Syrah,30.95,Definitely 'Syrah' rather than Shiraz in style terms and very Yarra, cool and taut with generous juicy dark fruit, lots of volume and a silky feel, all with an undercurrent of tension and energy from whole bunch fermentation. Gorgeously aromatic with pepper and Asian spice, lovely shape and balance.
2018 SAINT NICOLAS DE BOURGUEIL Les Malgagnes Domaine Yannick Amirault,30.95,We were lucky to be visiting the Amiraults the day they were harvesting this impressive Saint Nicolas de Bourgueil. Amongst the vines Benoit was overseeing a brilliant operation get this organic fruit in at exactly the right time - back at the winery Yannick was in charge of getting all the grapes into the tanks and settling in for the gentle long fermentation. The conditions were perfect and the vintage here has been hailed as one of the very best for more than 50 years. Tasting this it is hard not to agree. Sleekly polished but with great weight and delicate leafy spices. Dark fruit has crunch of blueberry, some violets and a lovely deep juiciness of firm plum. A stunner.
2017 BOURGUEIL La Petite Cave Domaine Yannick Amirault,30.95,NaN
2018 RULLY ROUGE Domaine Dureuil-Janthial,31.75,Three parcels. Sweetly soft, cushiony on the palate, gentle and pure, on soils with more clay than the Bourgogne, so less structure, but a lot of volume. Long, long finish.
2017 CHIANTI CLASSICO Riserva Bugialla Poggerino,31.95,The 2017 Chianti Classico Riserva Bugialla is another stellar wine in this range from Poggerino. Freshly cut flowers and sweet, red berry fruit give the 2017 a surprising amount of freshness. Medium in body, with terrific energy and plenty of verve, the 2017 Riserva is positively stellar. Rose petal, blood orange and spice overtones linger on the racy, exquisite finish. In a word: impressive.
2018 RUSTENBERG Peter Barlow Cabernet Sauvignon,30.95,NaN
2017 CHESTNUT HILL Pinot Noir Jayden Ong,32.75,Fresh ripe Pinot nose with some richness, and the palate has weight and a caressing silk feel. The finish is warmly ripe, staying taut (15% whole bunch fermentation). Really excellent Pinot.
2017 CHÂTEAUNEUF DU PAPE Tradition Domaine Jean Royer,32.5,All three of the 2017s showed well. The 2017 Châteauneuf-du-Pape has classic sweet red fruits, spice, and floral notes, and it’s medium to full-bodied, silky and elegant. The blend is 90% Grenache and 5% each of Cinsault and Syrah.
2018 SIN AZUFRE Pinot Noir Bodega Chacra,32.5,The most sophisticated wine we have ever tasted that has no added sulphur. Pure nose with cherry top notes and an open, easy, gentle feel on the palate. There's graceful and unimposing weight, and a lovely balance of acidity which gives a sense of lively energy.
2013 GIVRY 1er Cru à Vigne Rouge Domaine François Lumpp,32.95,Darker more brooding backward nose, black cherry, damson, sinew and spice. Power and grip on the palate, amazing acidity, again dark and sinewy, intense and impressive.
2015 CLOS MARGALAINE Margaux,32.5,Showy but not overdone, this lush Margaux is made by Philippe Porcheron's Château Marojallia - it's effectively the second wine, but production of the 'garagiste' first wine has varied considerably depending on demand. This is drinking beautifully now but well certainly hold for two or three years.
2016 CHINON Croix Boissée Domaine Bernard Baudry,32.95,NaN
2018 SANCERRE Cul de Beaujeu Rouge Chavignol Domaine Vincent Delaporte,32.95,NaN
2013 LADY MAY Grand Vin Glenelly Estate,31.95,The 2013 Lady May is a blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc, 4% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot matured in 100% new barriques for 24 months. It has a nicely detailed bouquet of blackberry, cedar and pencil lead aromas, and the Cabernet Franc component is quite expressive. The harmonious palate is medium-bodied with fine, supple tannin, underpinned by a very fine line of acidity. The pure blackberry, blueberry and graphite-infused finish lingers in the mouth. Of the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 , the 2013 is the best vintage. Excellent.
2017 SANCERRE Cul de Beaujeu Rouge Chavignol Domaine Vincent Delaporte,33.75,Domaine Delaporte are the only growers growing Pinot Noir on the Cul de Beaujeu - one of Chavignol’s most famous vineyards, a steep, southeast-facing slope with an incline of up to 60 degrees The vineyard was established by the monks of Beaujeu in the Middle Ages. Hand-picked grapes, fermented in stainless-steel but run through malo-lactic in oak and aged for a year before bottling. Precise, crisp red fruits, a silky touch, deceptively light and cooly refreshing. Anywhere a lighter Burgundy would normally find itself, the Cul de Beaujeu will charm and refresh with ease.
2018 DAMASCENE Syrah Stellenbosch,33.5,The freshness of this Syrah is so impressive, beautiful concentration, with dark fruit, plum and blackberry, ground pepper and spice. Richly tannic, overlaid with wild herbs, black fruit and spice, the acidity gives a cracking line to the palate. This is a wonderfully sculpted mouthful of prime Syrah, that will give pleasure over the next decade at least.
2018 SAINT JOSEPH Domaine G&J Bott,NaN,This is a really sophisticated St Joseph. Super bright on the nose, raspberry and cassis, touch of spice, ripe cherry middle is silky with plush blueberry perk, nicely soft tannin. Surprisingly elegant and super smart. It just flows so well, there's a satisfying weight of fruit and a lovely feel to this - an exciting new find!
2015 MOULIN À VENT Les Champ de Cour Domaine Thibault Liger-Belair, Beaujolais,34.5,A new addition - two hectares at the bottom of a combe, about 1.5m of soil on granite. Really impressive depth to this. Rich and powerful, but with a nice lift to it too. But there is no doubting the richness which is extreme.
2018 CENITO Aglianico Luigi Maffini,34.5,NaN
2018 AUTÉNTICO MALBEC Bodega Colomé,NaN,NaN
2018 SAINT NICOLAS DE BOURGUEIL Les Malgagnes Amphore Domaine Yannick Amirault,34.95,This Cuvée is fermented and aged in Amphora and it gives the wine a distinctive feel. Pure and lithe, the aromatics are pushed forward, blueberry, cherry and smoked tea, concise and taut. In the mouth that pure feel continues, fresh cool currant and cherry fruitiness, tea and tobacco leaf notes, hints of violets and fresh herbs. It is a wine that you find yourself going back to again and again as it refreshes and evolves as you drink it, best served cellar temperature.
2014 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET Rouge Goujonne Domaine Hubert Lamy,34.95,65 year -old vines - planted 1950. In terms of Olivier's reds, this is quite broad and firm and muscled - but still bright and firm with juicy fresh raspberryish acidity
2016 NERO DI SEI ETNA ROSSO Palmento Costanzo,34.95,80% Nerello Mascalese with 20% Nerello Cappuccio, from vines high up on Etna between 30 and 120 years old. Aged in large oak foudres. Ruby red, with intense fruit as and mineral notes finished with velvet-smooth tannins.
2015 MARSANNAY Champs Perdrix Domaine Huguenot,35.75,On Calcaire Comblanchien, the same hard marble-like stone that is quarried south of Nuits Saint Georges, so very much on the rock. Very dark colour. Very suave. Supple fruit, fine tannins, roundness of texture, but its still lively in the mouth, with a bit of spice in the tannins. There's just a sense today that this will have greater clarity and focus once it's a bit further down the line - the malolactic was late and it has not really had time to develop - previous vintages give us full confidence about where this is going - once it clarifies and gains focus it will be a joy.
2016 FIXIN Petits Crais Domaine Huguenot,35.75,Philippe explains that he must be very gentle with the wine-making to avoid over extraction or you get hard tannins and too much heft here. In 2016 he has been successful! It is more burley for sure. Quite broad and big. More shoulders than the Marsannay - but there is a really good level of fun and pleasure. Lots of well-rounded darker fruit. Nice feel and lifts to a cherry skin piquancy at the finish. Petit Crais are the small stones that cover the deep layer of 'Marne de Bresse' Clay subsoil. The Huguenot's Fixin vines are more on the clay and so it is no surprise that this feels broader generally than the other wines.
2015 NERO DI SEI ETNA ROSSO Palmento Costanzo,35.95,Notes of lightly cooked strawberries and olive-oil infused tomatoes here. Full-bodied and spicy on the palate and fruit-forward with dusty tannins. Drink now.
2016 BAROLO Barale Fratelli,34.95,This is a darker style with a lovely wild, almost pungent nose, earthy, spicy, dark cherry, raspberry and tar fragrance. In the mouth the wine is bold and rich, dark fruits in the mid-palate, cherry, loganberry and plum, spicy, earthy and with rich mouthfilling tannins that lend structure and shape to this cracking wine.
2016 BAROLO Andrea Oberto,35.95,The 2016 Barolo is fleshy, succulent and super-expressive, all of which make it an excellent choice for drinking now and over the next decade or so. Sweet red cherry, kirsch, cinnamon, mint and rose petal all flesh out in the glass, while soft, silky tannins give this forward Barolo plenty of near and medium-term appeal. This is such a delicious wine.
2016 POMMARD Vignots Domaine Joël Rémy,36.95,This is finer, more 'edged' than the Aloxe Corton. Very tightly furled for now. Puckering acidity and tannins. In a good way. Dense, ripe, powerful fruit. This vineyard is situated at the top of the hill and shaded by the trees there, from the sun and the frost. Good stuff. Deep red fruits. Delicious. 
2017 ESCONDITE DEL ARDACHO Veriquete Tentenublo,37.5,Roberto Oliván continues to produce exquisite wines with deep saturated colour and explosive aromatics like this. Veriquete is a plot that is just under half a hectare at nearly 600 Mtrs up in the Sierra Cantabria Hills. A blend of Tempranillo, Garnacha, Viura and Malvasia from vines that are between 50-100 years old. It is deep purple and bounds from the glass with damson, blueberry, raspberry and violets, deeply fruity on the palate with shapely firm tannins and a lovely kick of acidity to balance the whole. A fascinating snap-shot of modern Rioja.
2016 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET Rouge Goujonne Domaine Hubert Lamy,37.95,Nice feel. Tastes quite ripe reds fruit, but well checked, good grip too - and just enough darkness and seriousness underlying, but essentially this is ample and fleshy yet firmish. Remarkably good considering the very recent racking and sulphuring.
2018 SAINT JOSEPH Terres Neuves Domaine Lionnet,37.95,Dark but not opaque purple-edged colour. Dark, sweet blueberry nose, initially sweet supple first touch, juicy and sapid with just a little tannic astringency giving a mouthwatering freshness despite the considerable density.
2012 MERCUREY 1er Cru Champs Martin Domaine Bruno Lorenzon,39.5,The deep colour of 2012. Rich velvety body and ripe dark red fruit, all in balance and purity. This has a linen texture, firm but soft at the same time, and a well-developed dark spicy fruit with just a hint of classy oak. Drinking brilliantly now.
2015 RIPPON 'Rippon' Mature Vine Pinot Noir,39.5,A blend of parcels across the property, this has a deeply spicy array of mixed fruit, framed in aromas of flint, dark stones, pepper, woody spices, wild herbs and fresh earth. Texturally, this is super fine and taut, which reflects the schist soils found here. Very fine, powerful and athletic with sustained fruit flavors that are typical of Pinot Noir. Long ageing potential. Drink or hold.
2011 MERCUREY Cuvée Carline 1er Cru Champs Martin Domaine Bruno Lorenzon,39.95,Significantly plusher than the 'normal' cuvee. A richer nose with a touch of black pepper. A little more tannin, but more volume too so it's a rounder, even though marginally more structured wine. 80% whole bunches, 12 to 13 months in wood than second winter in tank. Vosne-textured, supple but taut and linear. Long and classy and still refreshing.
2017 ESCONDITE DEL ARDACHO El Abundillano Tentenublo,39.5,This one-hectare field blend of Garnacha with 10% Tempranillo and Malvasía was planted at the turn of the last century on red clay and sand soils. The resulting wine is rich and well upholstered with plenty of alcohol, a spicy, mulberry core and palate-cleansing acidity. Bold and complex.
2017 RULLY ROUGE 1er Cru Chapitre Domaine Dureuil-Janthial,39.5,Great intensity of fruit here, a lively balance of tannins, juice and weighty density. 
2017 LOS CORRILLOS Rock Abo Tentenublo,39.5,Whereas the 'Los Corrillos' label is for a blend of plots around Vinaspre, this one is a single vineyard with a rather rock'n'roll name - it's geographical co-ordinates feature on a label that is otherwise very like the other Los Corrillos label. A similarly taut and defined fruit with lively aromatics, lots of freshness and drive.
2015 MOREY SAINT DENIS Domaine Stéphane Magnien,39.95,A blend of four different parcels. Ripe, rounder and fully than Stéphane's village Chambolle, as one might expect, a soft feel with more velvet, slightly darker fruit expression, again with a bright tautness and attractively juicy.
2016 TOSCANA ROSSO IGT Podere Giodo di Carlo Ferrini,39.95,Nicely scented cherry, mint, earth, damson and touch of tobacco. Lovely glossy mouthfeel, really fine rich tannins, great acid backbone, lots of red fruits, then mocha, tobacco and earth.
2012 CHÂTEAU PIBRAN Cru Bourgeois Pauillac,38.95,The 2012 Pibran has a ripe, forward, black cherry and raspberry bouquet, the Merlot component very expressive and lending vivacious allure to the aromatics. The palate is medium-bodied with slightly chewy tannins on the entry. A pleasant edginess supplies fine tension and energy on the finish. This 2012 Pauillac comes recommended, and I can see it giving another decade’s worth of drinking pleasure. Tasted at the Pibran vertical at Château Pichon-Baron.
2013 AUXEY DURESSES 1er Cru Domaine Comte Armand,40.95,In contrast to the village Auxey, the malo had just finished. There's more depth and an attractive earthiness to the nose. All needs to settle down after the malo, as for now it tastes even younger than it is, but the brightness and purity of the fruit show where it is going, and it already shows a fine, supple, aromatic character.
2015 SANCTA CATHARINA Cantine Dei,40.95,NaN
2015 SALITA Sangiovese Selection Castagnoli,41.75,Salita has an intense ruby colour. On the nose it has pronounced fruity notes of cherry and raspberry, mild woody aroma and liquorice. The palate is is characterized by freshness, velvety tannins and by a very harmonious and persistent aftertaste. <br/> The Salita grapes come from a single south-facing vineyard. The 20 small terraces range from 420 to 360 meters above sea level. It is the most precious vineyard of the estate. The sunny terraces and careful caring by hand produce the top of the Castagnoli wine range.
2015 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET Rouge Goujonne Domaine Hubert Lamy,41.95,Olivier felt that 2015 was like 2005, so he tried to use lots of whole bunch in the reds - 70% in this. No sulphur until first racking. There's a lovely freshness and purity to the fruit, a sweetness and floral touch, with decent texture and supple ripe tannins.
2012 CHÂTEAU DE FIEUZAL Cru Classé Pessac-Léognan,41.95,The de Fieuzal Rouge has a succulent bouquet of blackberry, cassis and vanilla that is modern, well defined and showy. The palate is medium-bodied with a black coffee infused entry. The acidity is crisp and there is decent fruit concentration, but the finish is a little too oaky at the moment. Let us see how it melds during élevage.
2012 CHÂTEAU DE FIEUZAL Cru Classé Pessac-Léognan,41.95,The de Fieuzal Rouge has a succulent bouquet of blackberry, cassis and vanilla that is modern, well defined and showy. The palate is medium-bodied with a black coffee infused entry. The acidity is crisp and there is decent fruit concentration, but the finish is a little too oaky at the moment. Let us see how it melds during élevage.
2004 CHÂTEAU QUINAULT L'ENCLOS Saint Emilion,41.95,Alain Raynaud bought this property seven years ago, and has brought it up from a wine which was sold in lightweight bottles in supermarkets to where it is today. The vineyard is gravel, and is entirely surrounded by the town of Libourne (hence ‘l’Enclos). I did not taste this this year, but Robert Parker clearly liked it and the wine has fans from earlier vintages, so it should sell well at this price.
2014 CHÂTEAU LAFON-ROCHET 4ème Cru Classé Saint Estèphe,42.5,55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Merlot, 3% Cabenret Franc, 4% Petit Verdot. We have been keen followers of the wines from this great terroir over the last few years. They have done a great job again here in 2014. Lovely aromatic nose, cassis and more brambly fruit. Great feel, quite broad, so dense and there is an almost confected note to the dark plum fruit, deliciously ripe and nicely spicy. Silky, but compact core, lots to get your teeth into. Impressive and should be good value.
2009 MOULIN DU CADET Grand Cru Saint Emilion,44.95,NaN
2014 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN Cuvée Bertin Domaine Lignier-Michelot,44.75,A blunter, broader Gevrey nose to finish the run of Virgile's village wines. Cassis on the entry and then it picks up a bit of zip too - surprisingly bright with expression. Definitely delivers 'Gevrey'.
2015 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN Les Crais Domaine Huguenot,44.75,A gravel of broken limestone on the rubble washed down the combe. Little real soil makes this an early-ripening spot. Supple and silky, the limestone gives a surprising mineral brightness and energy. The freshness means it will keep the drive and juice. Nice finish.
2018 CORNAS Terre Brulée Domaine Lionnet,44.95,Black centre with a violet edge. A restrained nose combining darkest berry fruit and mineral precision. A well-formed feel from the first touch, dry, but not harsh. Concentrated very dark wild berry and brambly intensity, with a joyous interplay of the ripe sweet black fruit and enlivening acidity. Juicy and fresh, the tannins building but never overwhelming. A big wine with beautiful balance
2013 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN Domaine Thierry Mortet,45.95,Deep colour, good concentration on the nose, dark fruit, a touch of sweetness, fine tannins already so well melted into the wine. Beautifully balanced. '<em>Millerandage</em> saved us', said Thierry at the time - the small berries that result from a poor flowering and fruit set gave a considerable concentration to the wine.
2014 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY Vieilles Vignes Domaine Stéphane Magnien,44.95,All from a lieu-dit called les Athés, vines planted in 1902/3. Fine Chambolle floral fruit nose, and then the surprisingly dense powerful old vines palate. Full of juicy Pinot fruit and lightening length.
2018 CHÂTEAUNEUF DU PAPE La Dame Voyageuse Domaine de la Mordorée,44.95,Round and supple, the full-bodied 2018 Chateauneuf du Pape La Dame Voyageuse is a large-scaled ball of plum and blackberry fruit and savory nuances. Hints of mocha, black olive and licorice bring added interest to this soft, easygoing offering that should be consumed over the next 6-8 years.
2018 GUIDALBERTO Tenuta San Guido Incisa della Rocchetta,42.95,The 2018 Guidalberto, tasted from an approximate blend from barrel, is positively stellar. I can only hope that the bottled wine is as fresh, vibrant and nuanced as this sample. A rush of black cherry, plum, spice, leather and licorice graces the 2018 with striking depth and nuance. Light on its feet and deep, the 2018 has a lot to offer. In many years, Guidalberto can be a rather rich wine, but in 2018 it is very closely aligned with the house style.
2016 ESCONDITE DEL ARDACHO Las Guillermas Tentenublo,45.5,Wonderful aromas of ripe blackberries warmed by the sun along with more 'sauvage' notes of crushed stems and pith on the palate. Like the Veriquete, but possibly more so, this has immense complexity for such a young wine and shows great promise for the future - but the sample bottle was finished in double-quick time and we just kept wanting to come back to it - a wine that engages the mind as well as the senses.
2017 CÔTE RÔTIE Colline de Couzou Domaine Patrick & Christophe Bonnefond,47.75,A three week fermentation in stainless steel, with 20% whole bunches, before élevage for eighteen months in 400 litre barrels (10% new wood). Rich and vibrant black fruits on the nose, olive and mineral, fine and supple in the mouth with a touch of pepper and lots of black cherry and violets, very long and full, lots to like.
2016 ETERN Priorat Ritme Celler,47.95,This is a big boned beauty of a red. Filled with a deep draught of rich blackberry and plum fruit, there are notes of aniseed and dark chocolate folded into this plush fragrant cracker of a wine. One to accompany a plate of chateaubriand.
2016 BLASON DE L'ÉVANGILE Pomerol Château L'Évangile,45.95,The 2016 Blason de L'Évangile is bold and racy, with remarkable depth for a second wine. Supple, fruit and easygoing, the 2016 will give readers immense pleasure over the next handful of years. Floral notes and red berry fruit carry the Blason nicely. Blason is built on a core of young-vine Merlot, with 26% Cabernet Franc in the blend. The 2016 spent 14 months in once-used barrels.
2017 PRIMOFIORE Quintarelli,47.95,NaN
2016 CÔTE RÔTIE La Germine Domaine Benjamin et David Duclaux,49.5,Bright and lifted fruits, silky plum, redcurrant, blackcurrant with a mineral edge , spice with a touch of smoke too, a bigger style but again real elegance and precision, these are really quite brilliant wines and still very under the radar
2017 QUINTA DA ROMANEIRA Reserva,48.95,Lovely concentration, quite tightly wound, dark fruit core, bramble, dark cherry, then floral notes too of roses, violets with good freshness. The palate is beautifully delivered, concentrated black fruit, meaty and neatly spiced. It has the feel of a sleek Left Bank Claret and the hold too. Remarkable freshness and balance. Poised and sophisticated finishes with wonderful length. A blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca. 10 months in oak barrels, (a third new).
2016 BAROLO Vigneto Albarella Andrea Oberto,48.95,The 2016 Barolo Albarella is laced with sweet red cherry, blood orange, mint, white pepper and spice. Medium in body and bright, the 2016 pulses with a real sense of energy. This is recovering from its recent bottling, but it has so much to offer; bright acids give it a real sense of invigorating vitality. The 2016 is an especially fine edition of the Albarella. For medium-term drinking, the Albarella is one of the real gems of the year. Drink: 2023-2036
2014 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN Vigne Belle Domaine Thierry Mortet,50.95,Darker expression again. Cassis, good supple volume, weighty without heaviness. Pure and firm - Lots going on. Really very attractive, although Thiery say it tasted better the week before and that it is lacking expression today, which suggests there may be yet more to come.
2015 CONTRADA SANTO SPIRITO Palmento Costanzo,49.95,Enticing nose with a rich, weight of fruit. Warm red berries and some darker leafier elements create very charming aromatics. This follows to the palate on the attack, but then the pure feel builds intensity quickly. Delicious fine grained grip envelopes beautifully the darker, sleeker fruit core. There is energy and push here that is totally captivating. A savoury line and firmer dark currents and Mediterranean undergrowth notes add yet another dimension. This is pure and so clean-cut and it whistles along with great charm, but the breadth and many layers of contrasting fruit, herbs and gentle structure give real cause for thought. Fascinating and deeply satisfying wine from the this great estate on the high slopes of Etna. This wine comes from their oldest bush vines of Nerello Mascalese (90%) and Nerello Cappuccio. Organically grown, hand picked and raised for 24 months in the most beautiful egg shaped wooden barrels we have ever seen. Special stuff with the real ‘Spirito’ of this intriguing volcanic terroir.
2012 CHÂTEAU LA FLEUR CARDINALE Grand Cru Saint Emilion Château Fleur Cardinale,48.95,NaN
2015 PERNAND VERGELESSES 1er Cru Les Fichots Domaine Nicolas Rossignol,52.5,(from a 0.8-hectare vineyard planted on iron-rich rocky soil across from Corton-Charlemagne): Bright, dark red. Aromas of cherry, iron, tobacco and flowers show lovely clarity but suggest a dense wine. Highly concentrated, saline and deep, showing good medicinal reserve and energy to its black cherry fruit. Has the stuffing to support its tongue-dusting tannins on the sweet, long back end. This superb Pernand-Vergelesses wine won't be bottled until March or April, according to Rossignol, who noted that this cuvée does best in hot years like 2015, as it has a tendency toward strictness.
2018 CORNAS Pur Granit Domaine Lionnet,51.5,Pur Granit comes from an area known as Saint-Pierre, high up the slope, on (yes, you guessed it) a soil of degraded granite. The vines here are young, but it's a massal selection from the best of the domaine's old vines lower down, and the quality shines through. Not as dark as the Terre Brûlée, with the same vivid violet edge. A firm, but in no way aggressive dark fruit, with jewel-like precision and fresher acidity giving a mineral brightness and lift across the palate. Very attractive, long and pure.
2016 CONTRADA SANTO SPIRITO '466' Palmento Costanzo,50.95,This is from parcel 466 of the Palmento Costanzo estate and is matured in wooden eggs for 24 months prior to bottling. Sleek and concentrated dark fleshy fruit, herbs, aniseed, cherry and wild strawberry. In the mouth the wine is intense, sleek, with a concentrated mineral undertow, super fine tannins, rich acid, aromatic, berry fruit. A wine of superb balance and breeding, wonderful intensity, yet oh so poised, with real drive on the finish.
2016 BAROLO Castellero Barale Fratelli,50.95,The Castellero vineyard sits just above Cannubi and just below Bussia, so takes a bit of the character of both. There is a deep core of ripe fragrant raspberry, plum and hibiscus, rich yet mobile structured tannins and sleek bright acid. Multi-layered it is perfumed, bold yet nicely elegant, with plenty of depth and some of the classic tar, floral notes on the long finish.
2004 CLOS DU MARQUIS Saint Julien Château Léoville Las Cases,NaN,The initial impression is of a very strong sweet oakiness - rather new world in style. But the volume is there underneath and the dense fruit character of the wine shrugs off this coating and powers on with smooth dry Cabernet cassis and cherry on the finish. Massive. I like this but wish it had a bit more ‘cut’.
2015 BAROLO Bussia Sergio Barale,52.95,Bussia is renowned for the deep blue clay soil that lies beneath and always delivers wines with breadth and structure. Still very fine in the way it delivers everything, but a great depth of dark fruit fills out the core with sinew and intensity. Nice flesh and tannic richness envelopes layers of tar, damson, cherry and violet. The acidity is bright and balancing with great drive on the long finish.
2013 MOREY SAINT DENIS 'Petites Noix' 1er Cru Domaine Stéphane Magnien,53.95,'Petites Noix' is a name Stéphane has come up with for this cuvée, rather than being the vineyard name - it is a mixture of Gruenchers and Clos Bouley. Round and rich, but less 'in place' than the village wine. Lovely sour cherry fruit in a big ripe round mouthful which finishes bright and firm.
2015 JOANNI Merlot Fuligni,54.95,Relatively new offering from Roberto, in this vintage richly layered and textured with incredible balance and intensity, sleek and glossy, but maintaining a lovely line and finesse. 
2015 CHÂTEAUNEUF DU PAPE Cuvée de la Reine des Bois Domaine de la Mordorée,56.95,Richly concentrated and velvety in texture, the 2015 Chateauneuf du Pape La Reine des Bois is a full-bodied blend of 80% Grenache, 10% Mourvèdre, 5% Syrah and 5% split between Vaccarese and Counoise. While it's not the greatest vintage of this wine, it's still terrific, marrying plummy, black cherry fruit with a dusting of baking spices and Provençal herbs, finishing long and plush. It was a pleasure to meet the young and energetic Ambra Delorme, who is working with her mom to carry on Christophe's proud legacy in Tavel and nearby appellations. During my visit, we were capably assisted by Rémy Chauvet, the cellar master. Both were obviously pleased at the quality of the 2015s and 2016s but equally concerned about what looks to be a very small crop in 2017. As we wrapped up our quick tasting, Chauvet sagely pointed out that 
2011 LA RIOJA ALTA 904 Gran Reserva,53.5,From the third great vintage in a row, the 2011 Gran Reserva 904 is the product of one of only 14 vintages declared ‘excellent’ by the Rioja Consejo Regulador. Fantastically complex nose, rich and so enticing with the exotic smells of middle eastern spices, coconut and the whiff of incense. The warmth of the vintage shines here, on the palate the feel is sleek and harmonious. Loaded with well-integrated fruit punnet loads of rich cherries, blackberries and raspberries. Bolstered with lovely balanced notes of coffee, chocolate and baking spices. In the background there is some savour too - a whiff of game and leather. But is the intense, spiced luxurious feel here that is mesmerising. Juicy, spicy and sleek this is gorgeous. So approachable already, it is hard to resist - but this has legs and will continue to improve over the next decade. 
2018 RIDGE Geyserville Ridge Vineyards,56.25,The 2018 Geyserville is an infant. That much is obvious, especially in this lineup of otherwise more settled 2018s. Ripe Zinfandel flavors drive the overall profile. A blast of wild cherry, leather, tobacco, smoke, licorice, menthol and spice hit the palate first, followed by swaths of tannin and a touch of new oak that suggest the wine still needs time to come together. Readers should be in no rush. I am not sure the 2018 will ever be truly refined, as it is quite burly today. Aeration helps to some degree. The fermentations at Geyserville were slow to start and slow to finish. That longer time of extraction comes through in potent tannins that will likely always mark the wine.
2018 RIDGE Lytton Springs Ridge Vineyards,56.25,The 2018 Lytton Springs is magnificent. Elegant, layered and so complete, the 2018 has a lot to offer, but it needs time to fully come together. Sweet red cherry, red plum, blood orange, spice, mint and rose petal open up in the glass. Bright acids and beams of tannin give the wine its vibrant energy. Readers should plan on cellaring the 2018 for at least a few years. Wow!
2015 BARBARESCO Pajoré Sottimano,56.95,Of these various single-vintage releases by Sottimano (including Basarin, Cottá and Fausoni), the 2015 Barbaresco Pajorè is very well integrated and smooth. The tannin management shows an excellent approach, and you don't get the astringency that comes forward in the Basarin. Instead, this expression offers increased focus on the ripe, round and plump fruit of the vintage. Only 5,000 bottles (including magnums) were produced.
2016 ETNA ROSSO IGT SICILIA Alberelli di Giodo,NaN,Just bottled - and already so perfumed and joyous. Lovely, gentle nose. Really pretty, lovely floral lift and then more leafy and a whiff of dried herbs. Palate is deep and intense. Firmish feel - deep, dark fruit - but plum-skin pep too and gorgeous morello cherry bite. Sculpted core of gorgeously firm fruit. Such incredible detail and nuance. and fine lines. Gorgeous tiny fine tannins push all through this and drive it all on. Really superb stuff. When I mention how beautifully elegant this is to Carlo - he simply says ‘Eleganza, eleganza, eleganza!’ Cannot argue with that. 
2018 LE SERRE NUOVE DELL'ORNELLAIA Tenuta dell'Ornellaia,NaN,Really beautiful second wine from Ornellaia with blackcurrant and blueberry aromas and flavors. Full body and round, soft tannins that caress the palate.
2015 CHÂTEAUNEUF DU PAPE Les Sables de la Crau Domaine Jean Royer,57.95,Vivid ruby-red. Intense, sharply focused red fruit liqueur, spicecake and floral scents are complicated by suggestions of smoky minerals and Asian spices. Sappy, penetrating and appealingly sweet, offering silky raspberry and lavender pastille flavors that put on weight and spread out steadily with air. Closes smooth, sweet and impressively long, displaying suave, fine-grained tannins and resonating florality.
2015 VOLNAY Domaine Nicolas Rossignol,57.95,(from 5 different lieux-dits). A ripe, fresh and pretty nose combines notes of various red berries, soft earth and ample floral nuances. There is a discreet bead of minerality suffusing the dense yet sleek middle weight flavors that deliver solid depth and length. Note that this will need at least a few years of bottle age first. 
2009 CHÂTEAU GRAND PUY DUCASSE 5ème Cru Classé Pauillac,56.95,The nose is tight quite fresh the black fruits backed by a herbal leafy character. There is more sloe than sweet cassis and as the tannins are firm and structured they tend to close down the finish. 2018-35
2017 CÔTE RÔTIE Côte Rozier Domaine Patrick & Christophe Bonnefond,59.5,More expressive than the Couzou with the mineral core being a little more juicy, blackcurrant, violets, rose petal and elegant tight tannins all give the impression of a serious wine, although it is muscular it is still very elegant and pure with that classic Northern Rhône trademark violet-laced fruit
2017 CÔTE RÔTIE Les Rochains Domaine Patrick & Christophe Bonnefond,59.5,From a small plot next to La Landonne, on schist and iron-oxide-rich soil. The vinification is the same as for the 'Rozier', aged for 20 months with 30% new wood. Very ripe and dense but with real poise, saturated black fruits, mineral, smoke. Very pure and elegant as well as quite powerfully rich - still a lovely style.
2015 CHÂTEAU PEDESCLAUX 5ème Cru Classé Pauillac,57.95,52% Merlot, 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 6% Petit Verdot. Very dark, with a little spice in the round and smooth blackberry fruit. Some succulence and definition in the smooth volume which puts it ahead of some of the other lesser Pauillacs. A bit of bracing tannin. Quietly confident, quite juicy, jolly rather than serious. At the right price this could be a crowd-pleaser, drinking by 2020.
2015 POMMARD 1er Cru Clos du Verger Domaine Fernand & Laurent Pillot,NaN,Fresh, nice saline undercurrent which helps the tension - supple tannins and lots of fruit, dark and ripe. Very fine texture of tannins.
2014 GRAND MALBEC Cuvelier los Andes,59.95,Aging: 100% in new French oak barrels for 18 months.Appearance: great intensity of color. A very young and elegant violet-red, typical of the varietal. Aroma: excellent varietal characteristics which include aromas of sweet ripe plums, marmalade and dulce de leche. Very inviting. Mouth: very nice first mouth: full, juicy and meaty. Excellent roundness with a taste typical of the varietal. A robust, mature wine with a long finish. 
2013 MOREY SAINT DENIS 1er Cru Faconnières Domaine Stéphane Magnien,62.5,Not the density of Virgile Lignier's wine, for example, but this is its own thing, richer than his village wines, still with a lovely delicacy, and there is intensity too, but expressed in precision, with a lovely depth to the fruit. Great elegance.
2012 BARBARESCO Cottá Sottimano,58.95,60-70 year old vines, limestone & clay soils here - the vineyard is just next door to Asili & Rabaja. Rich saturated cherries, earth, strawberries and hawthorn, pure, palate has lovely grip, rich full tannins, ripe cherries and red berries, some sinew, macerated depth, mineral pure and long, fragrant with some oak notes on the long finish.
2010 TERRICCIO Castello del Terriccio,61.5,A wine of gravitas and power, the 2010 Castello del Terriccio doesn't quite have the sexiness of the Lupicaia today. Instead, the flavors are deep, darker and meatier, with considerable depth and formidable tannins that need time to start resolving themselves. The 2010 Castello is a wine for the patient.
2012 BARBARESCO Fausoni Sottimano,58.95,Medium pronounced mint and liquorice, cherries and strawberry. Palate is rich concentrated, supple with good fruit drive in the core then liquorice, some oak notes then a mineral drive.
2004 CHÂTEAU FEYTIT CLINET Pomerol,59.95,Attractive, fruit-filled and not over-extracted, with weight and volume and a fresh, gourmand richness. Very nicely done.
2013 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY 1er Cru Sentiers Domaine Stéphane Magnien,61.95,Great delicacy of raspberry and cherry-stone fruit, but the overwhelming impression is a wine of place, of a firm chalky soil which gives it a character all of its own, more about mineral and light and airy scent than fruit. The finish is remarkable for chalky, talc-fine tannins which really lift it. This is just under Bonnes Mares and Stéphane says it always has this chalky character. Very fine.
2017 ATA RANGI Pinot Noir,59.95,Really pristine fruit aromas here with such pure, ripe red cherries and roses, as well as gently earthy and spicy nuances. Very fresh, precisely ripe and a pinot you can sit and just breathe in for days. The palate has a velvety layer that few others manage to find; silky at the core, succulent in the center and delivering such vibrant, red-cherry flavors in a long, pristine and fresh, red-cherry finish. Drink or hold. Screw cap.
2016 SIOPE Aglianico Luigi Maffini,62.95,This is a new wine from Luigi and is the result of the painstaking work that he has undertaken, to find the best expression of Aglianico, from his vineyards situated in the area of Guingano. Harvested by hand from a 1.3 hectare Cru and sorted twice prior to crushing, then fermented and aged for 12 months in new French oak barrels. It spends a further 2 years in bottle prior to release. Luigi strives to make a wine that is powerful and densely fruited, but that retains freshness, balance and poise, something that he achieves here with aplomb. The fruit is of the red spectrum and there is a beautifully integrated seam of spice that runs through the palate. This wine will age beautifully, if of course you can keep your hands off it. Siopé apparently means silence in ancient Greek, the sound that Luigi hears when he walks through his vineyards. Organically grown and just 3,080 bottles produced.
2017 COTEAUX CHAMPENOIS Ambonnay Rouge Athénaïs Gonet-Médeville,64.95,From a third of a hectare of old vines planted in 1905. Xavier remains true the ideas for his Champagnes - that is to say he is seeking full ripeness, and the wine is all aged in barrel. A deep colour and bright cherry fruit, with a spicy overlay and pure silky feel. Long on red berry and pure Pinot juice.
2013 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN 1er Cru Fonteny Domaine Huguenot,65.0,Powerful and massive wine from clayey soil next to grand cru Ruchottes. There is dark colour, and rich tannin as well as fruit - a bit of a brute but no shortage of character, and the fruit is very much equal to the structure, it just needs time to harmonise.
2013 MOREY SAINT DENIS 1er Cru Charmes Domaine Lignier-Michelot,63.75,As it sounds, a soft style, mouthfilling and sophisticatedly sweet, there's freshness too and it just gets richer and richer.
2015 POMMARD 1er Cru Charmots Domaine Fernand & Laurent Pillot,66.95,Charmots returns, having been obliterated by hail in both 2013 and 2014, and returns in triumph, in it's usual style, which is like its name, charming. Fine-textured, supple, silky-velvet, Laurent has used 50% whole bunches and this lifts the middle and lengthens the finish.
2013 MOREY SAINT DENIS 1er Cru Les Chenevery Domaine Lignier-Michelot,66.75,A much firmer style, less expressive on the nose, tauter and harder. The tannins are firm but the fruit is there, not lush, but bracing, piquant, spicy.
2013 POMMARD 1er Cru Rugiens Domaine Fernand & Laurent Pillot,69.95,Dark garnet colour. Rich body; a chunky, completely ripe and full wine, but one which needs a little time to come together, with the structure poking though in places.
2015 CÔTE RÔTIE La Viallière Domaine Clusel-Roch,67.5,Vivid, with lovely energy throughout thanks to a light bramble edge amid the mix of black currant, raspberry and plum compote flavors. Light anise and black tea hints score the finish. Best from 2020 through 2031.—
2002 DOMAINE DE CHEVALIER Cru Classé Pessac-Léognan,NaN,This looks to be a very good Domaine de Chevalier, with excellent colour, round and harmonious, fresh compared with many of the Graves, though lacking a bit of grace in the mid-palate.
2013 MOREY SAINT DENIS 1er Cru Aux Chezeaux Domaine Lignier-Michelot,68.95,Very harmonious nose with a touch of cherry-stone ('Burlat cherry stone', says Virgile, showing how the French just know more about varieties of fruit and veg than anyone), and very fine tannins which give a certain body and fleshiness, and still the insistent pointed fruit enlivens it all, purple and bright.
2011 POMMARD 1er Cru Croix Noires Domaine de Courcel,71.95,Still in malo when I tasted, but lots of wine here, just a bit hard to discern as yet.
2013 MOREY SAINT DENIS La Rue de Vergy Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,73.95,Attractive, quite full on the palate with balance and juice, but it was a little flattened by a recent SO2 adjustment when I tasted, and I'd expect it to put on weight and distinctiveness.
2014 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,72.5,Also bottled after the 2015 harvest. After the Rue de Vergy, this has more obvious depth of Gevrey black fruit, a suave round ball of fruit and satisfyingly mouthfilling body.
2014 CHÂTEAU TALBOT 4ème Cru Classé Saint Julien,71.5,Very impressive on the attack, quite bright fruit with lovely concentration. Lots of lifted red plum and a creamy spicy weight. Oak presence does build towards the finish, but everything is in place for a longish future. 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot, 6% Petit Verdot.
2016 CHACRA '32' PINOT NOIR Treinta y Dos Bodega Chacra,73.5,This comes from the old vines (planted in 1932!) on the first plot that Piero bought. A soil that is rich in limestone pebbles gives a wine which has a firm density, and it can age brilliantly, while at the same time the tannins are fine and really add a sense of soft weight, so it's inviting and not harsh even when young. There's spice and mineral as will as tightly complex wild fruit intensity and a long finish.
2013 MOREY SAINT DENIS 1er Cru Faconnières Domaine Lignier-Michelot,75.5,Deep black fruit expression on the nose - almost a touch of tar. Palate is big - a mouthfilling old-vine richness, veering towards heaviness but certainly achieving opulence, a sense of red velvet roses. 'Like having a big bunch of grapes in the mouth', says Virgile.
2014 CHÂTEAU FEYTIT CLINET Pomerol,73.95,The Château Feytit-Clinet 2014 is another strong effort from Jeremy Chasseuil who has reinvigorated this Pomerol cru in recent years, almost under the radar (apart from perhaps the Pomerol cognoscenti and those that bought my tome.) This year is a blend of 94% Merlot and 6% Cabernet France picked between 29 September and 10 October, matured in 80% new French oak. It is very refined on the nose, very subtle, a sample that you have to spend time with. It unfurls with mulberry and seaweed scents. The palate is medium-bodied with firm tannin that lend this Pomerol a sense of mineralité, but there is a lovely crescendo here towards a finish that fans out beautifully. This is a sophisticated, understated and quite intellectual showing.
2014 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN 1er Cru Clos Prieur Domaine Thierry Mortet,79.5,Deep colour again, More elegance to the fruit here - more lift. A very generous supple richness on the palate. Long on cassis, and so much mineral too, giving a lively energy to it. Richly concentrated.
2011 CORTON BRESSANDES Grand Cru Domaine Chandon de Briailles,77.5,Dark fruit, intensity and a kind of feral weight, which is nonetheless pure. Looking good for seven or eight years' time.
2013 VOLNAY 1er Cru Santenots Domaine Nicolas Rossignol,82.75,Three different parcels which he characterises as being 'finesse, flesh and structure'. He works to accentuate these characters, and then blends it back to a harmonious whole. The result is a wine that has real depth and complexity, and a surprising complete harmony too. This is a terroir which gives big wines, far from the 'feminine' side of Volnay - lots of body and texture.
2013 POMMARD 1er Cru Chaponnières Domaine Nicolas Rossignol,82.75,(just 12 hectoliters per hectare produced): Healthy dark red. Aromas and flavors of dark plum and licorice. Round and silky on entry, then lively but tight in middle, showing a restrained sweetness. Finishes with a note of maraschino cherry and serious broad tannins that dust the front teeth. 
2005 CHÂTEAU BELLEVUE Grand Cru Classé Saint Emilion,79.5,Deep pure colour, fat pure and round, a supple ball of fruit and seamless texture.
2012 BARBARESCO Curra' Sottimano,82.95,Paler in colour, nose is very pure, cherries, spice, liquorice and flowers, very elegant. Palate is incredible, such depth and drive, rich saturated cherry, plums, spice, herbs and mineral drive, radiates energy and vigour, very fine and pure with sublime length.
2012 VOLNAY 1er Cru Chevrets Domaine Henri Boillot,82.5,A round completeness of ripe black fruit on the nose. Dense yet delicate, silky, fresh and pure. Lovely line through the palate which goes on and on.
2012 VOLNAY 1er Cru Fremiets Domaine Henri Boillot,82.5,The ripest in expression, with some coal-black flavours and dark spice. Rich but also rounded and gourmand. Quite supple and fat. Smooth ripe tannins.
2008 VOLNAY Mise Tardive de Sept Ans 1er Cru Santenots Domaine Nicolas Rossignol,85.25,Nico did an bottling of this wine at the normal time, but still had quite a lot in tank when he had to move cellars. The wine was put in demi-muids (600l barrels) and moved to the cellar he shared with Ben Leroux. When Nico moved again, he retasted the wine and decided he liked the way it was aging in bulk, but that it still needed more time. Now, finally, after seven years of this quiet elevage in barrel, he has bottled it.
2013 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN Grand Cru Domaine Huguenot,85.95,Philippe's vines in Charmes are right up under Griotte Chambertin, where there is more stone ('calcaire d'entroques' or crinoidal limestone) and this gives wines with more elegance - the topsoil soil is very shallow here. An immediately appealing florally fruity nose, and the palate shows delicacy behind the ripe but fine fruit. Very elegant and linear.
1996 CHÂTEAU LAFON ROCHET 4ème Cru Classé Saint Estèphe,84.5,One of the sleepers of the 1996 vintage, Lafon-Rochet has turned out an atypically powerful, rich, and concentrated wine bursting with black currant fruit. The opaque purple color gives way to a medium to full-bodied, tannic, backward wine with terrific purity, a sweet, concentrated mid-palate, and a long, blockbuster finish. This wine remains one of the finest values from the luxury-priced 1996 vintage, and is well-worth purchasing by readers who are willing to invest 5-6 years of patience; it should keep for two decades. Anticipated maturity: 2005-2020.
2014 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY Vieilles Vignes Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,85.0,Nice contrast to the Gevrey, this is a lovely juicy lifted style with classic Chambolle floral fruit. Quite relaxed, very pretty. This is 40% from Combe d'Orveau (premier cru), and 60% old vines from other plots.
2011 POMMARD 1er Cru Grand Clos des Épenots Domaine de Courcel,89.5,Properly rich. A huge sensual weight of deep black fruit and succulent juiciness. Damson and blackberry fruit, but so much else besides - saline and intense too.
2012 BRUNELLO DI MONTALCINO Riserva Padelletti,89.95,Brunello indeed to look at, with tawny edge and deep dark middle. Complex nose of spice and polished wood, with silky intensity and a power almost hidden by the polish. Powerful and intensely long, leaving a lasting impression. The fruit is developing nicely with some dried plum touches, aniseed, meat juices, balsamic, concentrated and persistent, it will offer fine drinking for a long time to come.
2013 BEAUNE Rouge 1er Cru Clos des Mouches Domaine Joseph Drouhin,90.5,Notes of smoky reduction block an evaluation of the nose though there is good vibrancy to the impressively dense medium weight flavors that exude a fine minerality onto the tension-filled, bright and mildly austere finish. The acidity is prominent but not drying and while the balance isn’t perfect my sense is that this will come together if given a few years of cellar time first. 2019+
2013 BRUNELLO DI MONTALCINO Podere Giodo di Carlo Ferrini,89.95,Liquorice, cedar, savoury, touch meaty, scented and fine with stone fruit. Gorgeous fruit delivery, sleek, mobile elegant and ripe, blackberry, plum and touch creamy, savoury with liquorice and cedar.
2007 CHÂTEAU LÉOVILLE POYFERRÉ 2ème Cru Classé Saint Julien,88.95,Lovely ripe Cabernet nose. Palate fleshy, soft, good weight of cassis and cherry with graphite and oaky complexity. Dark fruit flavour is drawn across the palate by the fine tannins. Very sexy and feminine, all in elegance and brightness of tone, with lovely intensity on the finish.
2011 POMMARD 1er Cru Rugiens Domaine de Courcel,95.0,To begin with this seems almost bizarrely soft and sexy, but then the tannins kick in and the fruit bulids and intensifies. Really dense and exciting, mineral. Spicy too on the finish, and there is still a sweetness to the tannins. 'Tannins de Piedmont', says Yves.
2012 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN 1er Cru Petite Chapelle Domaine J. Confuron Cotetidot,98.0,As one might reasonably expect, this is markedly more aromatically elegant with a high-toned and ultra-pure nose of extract of cherry with top notes of violet and subtle spice hints. There is an equally pure feel to the almost tender medium weight flavors that possess a lacy mouth feel before tightening up considerably on the mineral-inflected, balanced and lingering finish that offers good if not truly exceptional depth. 2022+
2011 LUPICAIA Castello del Terriccio,100.0,There is evident heat to the fruit in the 2011 Lupicaia, but the balsam intensity or tertiary aromas also come through. The wine shows green notes of grilled herb and a sharper, more defined level of fruit intensity. The wine is profound and deep. The tannins are very well integrated, and the wine shows a vertical softness that makes this vintage stand out from the rest. I could see it pairing nicely with the classic Tuscan veal stew, spezzatino di vitello.
2013 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN 1er Cru Lavaux Saint Jacques Joseph Drouhin,98.5,NaN
2013 POMMARD 1er Cru Rugiens Henri Boillot,102.95,Tasted after the intensity of the Volnay Caillerets, this at first seems quite smiley, sweet and supple for a Rugiens, but the density and power is here too. The powerful tannins build to a roar of red and black fruit intensity, and some classy structure on the finish. Really excellent.
2013 VOSNE ROMANÉE Champs Perdrix Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,99.95,The 2013 Vosne-Romanée Champs Perdrix Vieilles Vignes is backed up by serious structure and mid-palate density, especially at this level. Dark red cherry, plum, spice and tobacco meld together in a firm village-level Burgundy that is going to need time to soften. The 2013 is impressive, but also far from an easygoing wine. I imagine it will offer a good decade-plus of fine drinking.
2016 PREFILLOSSERA Palmento Costanzo,104.95,Delicate rose notes over the dense maraschino cherry fruit, with subtle nuttiness of oak, chilli spice and a leafiness suggesting some stems in the ferment. Ripe maraschino, spice and stones, with compact, firm tannins that will take time to unwind. Perfumed, spicy, long finish. Serious stuff.
2002 CHÂTEAU LÉOVILLE BARTON 2ème Cru Classé Saint Julien,NaN,Not staggeringly deep in colour, but as usual this has an indefinably classy royal purple aspect. The nose is warm with the ripeness of black fruit and a deep cedary complexity. Sophisticated complex flavour to go with the dry velvet plush texture. Finish firm, grippy and long. A wine that will need waiting for, but definitely one of my favourites.
1999 CHÂTEAU LÉOVILLE POYFERRÉ 2ème Cru Classé Saint Julien,103.95,A cracker this year. Fat, good oak. Less of the over-extracted blue colour of some recent vintages here, lots of cassis and mûre fruit.
2014 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN 1er Cru Cazetiers Joseph Drouhin,113.5,Sweet fruit nose. Round and (in the context of Drouhin wines), voluminous, yet still pinging with bright fruit - tight as a drum. Really rather beautiful, feels like a wine from rock, fine and long, a really rather wonderfully balanced Gevrey.
2013 MOREY SAINT DENIS Vieilles Vignes 1er Cru La Riotte Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,114.5,This needs air to reveal the pure cherry and raspberry fruit, framed by spice and earth accents. Still, this stays square and solid, with dense tannins lining the finish. Fine length. Best from 2020 through 2035.
2012 CLOS SAINT DENIS Grand Cru Domaine Stéphane Magnien,119.95,Rich spicy nose (there's new wood here). Very fresh and rich and pure and harmonious, coupled with finesse and elegance. 65-70 year old vines in the middle of what Stéphane is keen to point out is the old Clos Saint Denis - before the appellation covered a wider area. Chiselled definition.
2001 CHÂTEAU CALON SÉGUR 3ème Cru Classé Saint Estèphe,110.0,35% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc, 50% Cabernet Sauvignon. Super deep rich ruby colour. The attack is in perfect balance, fruit ripe but not overripe, pure and full. And fruit is what one tastes, despite 50% new wood, and 25% malo-lactic in barrel. Tannins are there, and are firm, but not out of proportion to the fruit and volume of the wine. Very good. I like this lots. The Merlots were picked before the rain (in just four days, starting 25th September) and nearly all this wound up in the Grand Vin.
2011 POMMARD Vieilles Vignes La Levrière Domaine Bernard Dugat-Py,110.0,Seems quite oaky, but it's really just that the fruit is a little on the back foot. In need of a racking? No doubting the volume; it's as rich and full as it could be. Rich and tense and relaxed and velvety all the the same time.
2012 CORTON BRESSANDES Grand Cru Domaine Chandon de Briailles,129.95,Showing well for a couple of years now, open nose, rich and full, with good chewy black-cherry length. Of course it will keep, but this is good drinking.
2006 CHÂTEAU CALON SÉGUR 3ème Cru Classé Saint Estèphe,115.95,33% Merlot, 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Petit Verdot. Nose of warm ripe berry fruit. On palate pure ripe rasberries and a silky suave feel. Taut acidity. Good juicy style - relatively simply and attractively balanced and long.
1986 CHÂTEAU TROPLONG MONDOT Saint Emilion,114.95,NaN
2014 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY 1er Cru Les Baudes Joseph Drouhin,113.25,Finer yet on the nose than the Premier Cru 'cuvee', with a plusher volume and darker fruit, not as lifted, lean and keen, but a relaxed rich boy. Super-long too.
2012 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN Grand Cru Domaine Stéphane Magnien,123.5,This is mostly in Mazoyères. Planted 27 years ago, two clones, and originally pruned in cordon to reduce vigour, but some did not do well so he has moved to guyot. Best wine in the 'Bourgogne Aujourd'hui' tasting of the 2012s, quite an accolade. Rich and round and full-bodied, elegant but meaty Gevrey fruit in appetising length. Even with 100% destemmed fruit it has a powerful tannic structure. Very classy.
2012 POMMARD 1er Cru Épenots Domaine Nicolas Rossignol,126.25,A tiny toasty note on the nose, and smells crunchy and crisp and this is borne out on the palate, which fresh and precise, incisive, compact, pure, really fine. Immediately appealing and gorgeous balance.
2011 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN Coeur de Roy Domaine Bernard Dugat-Py,123.95,More than fruit here - liquorice, ripe plum, still the tonic, tannins bringing freshness. Gorgeously rich and mouthfilling. Pure, spicy, complex. More black grape-skins on the finish, an attractive bitterness from the thick-skinned grapes from these very old vines.
1996 CHÂTEAU LAGRANGE 3ème Cru Classé Saint Julien,119.5,Like the Fiefs, Cabernet dominates. Classic, tight and straight, but with a richness of texture and velvety feel, and still a considerable freshness of fruit. Really excellent, and the spice of wood that the carefully managed élevage at Lagrange will bring to it will undoubtedly do wonders. Marcel Ducasse is rightly proud of it, and says that for him it is the best vintage yet of Lagrange. ‘The grand publique may prefer the 1990, but I do not like wines that are so thick (épais) - this is more like a true Médoc.
1995 CHÂTEAU DUHART MILON ROTHSCHILD 4ème Cru Classé Pauillac,125.95,Made from a blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon/20% Merlot, the 1995 is slightly sweeter, more supple and slender than the broader-shouldered 1996. The wine's bouquet offers aromas of ripe berry fruit intermixed with minerals, toasty oak, and spice. Medium-bodied, with fine extract, it is a finesse-styled Pauillac (in the best sense of the word). Anticipated maturity: 2002-2014.
2011 CORTON CLOS DU ROI Grand Cru Domaine Chandon de Briailles,124.75,Starts less impressively than the more expressive Bressandes, but picks up. A core of sweetness, delicate concentration without huge body. Lovely tannins on the finish.
2008 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN Grand Cru Domaine J. Confuron Cotetidot,125.0,Opulent certainly, but with malo not done it is hard to see the 'charm' side. Lots of dark fruit and chew, but still barely evolved.
2005 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN 1er Cru Lavaut Saint Jacques Domaine J. Confuron Cotetidot,130.0,Good full red. Initially less fruity and up-front than the Petite Chapelle. Wild, very ripe aromas and flavors of spicy red berries and licorice. Wonderfully penetrating and vibrant for the year, with superb life to its juicy flavors. Still youthfully tight but very pure and perfumed, with the wine's sweetness partly hidden by its firm tannic spine. This is really remarkably brisk for 2005, with a very long and scented aftertaste. Rich and intense - lovely. Blackberry jam yet forceful and dry - eatable, moreish and with savoury length. A great example of what vinification with stems can achieve in a thoroughly ripe year. 
2007 CHÂTEAU LYNCH BAGES 5ème Cru Classé Pauillac,130.0,75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 15% Merlot, 2% Petit Verdot. Cool weight of black, fresh, sexy suave fruit. Classical and rich, with impressive weight and power. Graphite minerals and sumptuous cassis. Seriously attractive, very long and one of the hits of the year.
2010 ROSSO DEL BEPI Quintarelli,134.95,NaN
2005 POMMARD 1er Cru Rugiens Domaine de Courcel,129.5,The hard subsoil of the upper part of Rugiens shows in the crunchy backbone of this massively structured wine. Firmly mineral to the point of aggression - it will get there, but not one to taste too early.
2005 CORTON BRESSANDES Grand Cru Domaine Chandon de Briailles,135.0,As always the Bressandes stands out among the Cortons - the Maréchaudes is rather big and blunt by comparison, but this has the usual wild fruit character, a brightly defined wine with cut and class. Quite tannic, with a lively long crisp finish. It will always be expressive.
2011 MESSORIO Le Macchiole,135.0,Clearly very ripe vintage, with some jamminess and dried character to the black-cherry and plum fruit. Coffee, vanilla and cedar oak expression. Plush palate, with some black-tea maturity showing through, then mouth-coating tannins grip the palate. Long, espresso finish shows there's some class here, even in a ripe vintage. Not necessarily my style, but there's a lot of class and care that has been put into this wine. 
2002 CHÂTEAU LYNCH BAGES 5ème Cru Classé Pauillac,NaN,This marks a better showing for Lynch Bages, this bottle retaining the austere, stoic facade but behind it more evidence of blueberry, iodine and violets. Good lift with an undercurrent of sous-bois. Very ripe entry, chewy tannins, blackberry, boysenberry and graphite leading to a dense, dry introverted finish. Tasted October 2009.
2005 CHÂTEAU GAZIN Pomerol,138.5,The Gazin ’05 seems to be coming into its own after a relatively abrasive youth and each time I return I have to increase my score. Tasted blind, this has an earthy nose, sloes, mulberry. Lacks a little definition but imbued with a sense of mineralité with those mulberries growing in intensity. Earthy entry, black pepper, fine tannins, a little angular but that should round out in time. Nice character and rusticity. Very fine. Drink 2012-2020.
2013 VOSNE ROMANÉE 1er Cru Beaux Monts Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,150.95,From the top of les Beaumonts, on the rock. Super colour. Nose confused, not leaping out, but the palate weight is the is a crystalline purity of directed, mineral fruit - lovely. Tannins consistent withthe rock underneath - chalk-fine. Super-long finish in which all is integrated into one rather glorious whole. Lots of natural richness here, and the length is impressive.
2002 CHÂTEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU 2ème Cru Classé Saint Julien,NaN,82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot. In contrast to the Grand Puy Lacoste in the same 'stable', Ducru is sweet to taste, round and ripe, all of one piece, tannins fine but very present giving a feel of volume, an impression of lots of dry extract. Lots of fruit too, complex mulberry and plum, the whole thing wonderfully long and warm.
2005 CORTON POUGETS Grand Cru Domaine de Montille,160.0,NaN
1995 CHÂTEAU GRAND PUY LACOSTE 5ème Cru Classé Pauillac,165.95,Another unbelievably rich, multidimensional, broad-shouldered wine, with slightly more elegance and less weight than the powerhouse 1996, this gorgeously proportioned, medium to full-bodied, fabulously ripe, rich, cassis-scented and flavored Grand-Puy-Lacoste is a beauty. It should be drinkable within 4-5 years, and keep for 25-30. This classic Pauillac is a worthy rival to the other-worldly 1996. Anticipated maturity: 2002-2025. 
1996 CHÂTEAU GRAND PUY LACOSTE 5ème Cru Classé Pauillac,170.0,At last shedding its tannins and revealing fabulously rich fruit and great elegance. A wonderful Pauillac.
2014 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY Vieilles Vignes 1er Cru Les Fuées Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,180.0,A nose that seems further-evolved, old dark red roses, heady and deeply floral. So floral it is quite extreme, but I love it - a touch of very dark chocolate on the finish. Quite full enough and the aromas linger. From vines opposite Bonnes Mares.
2004 CHÂTEAU L'ÉGLISE CLINET Pomerol,175.5,Denis Durantou was keen to say that this is not just a classic vintage, but a return to ‘normal’ after several vintages of extremes - the yield is close to a long term average - and this is again a vintage of blending - all the Cabernets went in - and balance of fruit, alcohol and tannin - nothing excessive in any way. It is a fabulously rich colour, very oaky which sweetens up the fruit - very 
2001 CHÂTEAU PICHON LALANDE 2ème Cru Classé Pauillac,NaN,Ripe just to the last possible point before being sweet. Complete and completely full, with complexity coming. Great depth - there are classical black depths of pencil-lead to plumb. A beautifully-structured, super wine. This is clearly an better wine than the slightly disappointing (for Pichon Lalande) 2000.
2011 NUITS SAINT GEORGES Vieilles Vignes Ultra 1er Cru La Richemone Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,195.0,This is reduced but not so much that the ripeness of the underlying fruit isn't reasonably apparent. There is a silky, even satiny mouth feel to the solidly well-concentrated medium-bodied flavors that exude structure-buffering dry extract on the impressively long and mineral-inflected finish. This delivers a striking combination of finesse and power.
2003 CHÂTEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU 2ème Cru Classé Saint Julien,188.25,The Bories have sorted out their succession so that Bruno and his sister have taken control of Ducru, while Xavier, who has been running Ducru, Haut Batailley and Grand Puy Lacoste, has retained control of the other two. Ducru is a big, much chewier wine than usual, as are many in this vintage. There is a taut tannic structure and a concentrated density which is nearly minty. A huge mouthfilling wine with masses of very present tannins giving a giant, dense, fruity, pain d'épices length. It gives a powerful impression of vigorous youth, tasting as though it had only just finished its fermentation. Very impressive.
2012 CLOS DE LA ROCHE Grand Cru Domaine Lignier-Michelot,199.95,50% whole bunch here, all new wood, yet no wood taste discernable. I love the purity and directed length of this. Fantastic. 'Opulent' says Virgile.
2011 CLOS VOUGEOT Grand Cru Domaine Joseph Drouhin,203.5,This is really quite floral in character with unusually elegant red berry fruit, especially red currant scents that display plenty of soil tones. There is fine volume and excellent mid-palate density to the medium-bodied flavors that are supported by markedly firm but not aggressive tannins on the moderately austere and impressively persistent finish. This is very much a classic Clos de Vougeot and patience will absolutely be required as I don’t see this being particularly approachable young. 2023+
2005 ÉCHEZEAUX Grand Cru Domaine J. Confuron Cotetidot,220.0,Round, opulent, sexy, full and sweet. Easy and supple, stuffed with ripe blackberry - like a supercharged Gevrey? Lots of volume and easy to taste, Yves remarks that this is 'on the defensive' at the moment - its hard to imagine, given how easy it is to taste, what it can be like when its on the attack.
2014 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY Cuvée Ultra 1er Cru Combe d'Orveau Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,240.95,4 barrels from 0.6 of a hectare. Another jump up in class. There's a completeness and harmony of all the elements - taut but rich fruit, energy and bounce and yet a sort of cool severe grace too. Fills all corners of the mouth. Lovely poise as it spreads wide across the palate, an impressive fan which still delivers great length.
2011 MAZOYÈRES CHAMBERTIN Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,246.25,Sweeter, riper, denser and 'hairier' than the Charmes. There's rigid minerality, a kind of Giacometti frame. Spicy and long.
2011 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,255.95,Lush, yet vibrant. All silk and sweetness, held in check only just. Sexy and rich. Lovely length and depth of red black fruit. Cassis is there, nice and bright. A real burst of bright juicy flavour on the finish.
2001 CHAMBERTIN CLOS DE BÈZE Domaine Bouchard Père et Fils,240.0,NaN
2011 CHAPELLE CHAMBERTIN Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,235.0,Good saturated ruby-red. Shy, brooding aromas of blackberry, violet and licorice convey a tiny-berry character. A densely packed, creamy bomb of black fruits on the palate: hugely concentrated and sweet, utterly seamless and extremely primary for the vintage. The tannins are perfectly buffered on the whiplash of a finish, which mounts inexorably.
2004 CHÂTEAU PALMER 3ème Cru Classé Margaux,245.0,Medium colour. Very fruity nose and attack, sweet expression, some of which is coming from the slightly obvious oak. But the fruit is dominant and the whole mouthful is very harmonious, fine, silky and velvety at the same time as being fresh, dry and supple. Lovely but not quite the stuffing for greatness? Very much in the style of classic Palmer though.
2014 CHAPELLE CHAMBERTIN Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru Domaine Christophe Perrot-Minot,272.5,Very big-boned, but not burly. Rich and dense and so silky, a calm presence on the palate that gradually reveals its energy as the black fruit fans out. Really exciting.
2011 AMARONE Quintarelli,275.0,From the undoubted king of Valpolicella, Quintarelli's wines are some of the most fascinating of the whole Veneto. The Amarone is never heavy or overdone, it has concentrated plum and cherry fruit, but the feel is lithe and fresh, rich textured tannins give shape and mouthfeel, whilst the acidity underpins and pushes the wine forward. This has the hallmark of all fine wines in the way that it never overawes the senses and keeps drawing you back for another sip.
2015 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN Grand Cru Thibault Liger-Belair,280.5,70% whole bunch. 80% new wood, but barrels with no toast. The start is all Charmes, relaxed, easy, but then it gains in energy and precision, ripe blackcurrant and blackberry, building nicely in intensity.
1963 TAYLOR,295.0,<em>(This was UK bottled by Lupton’s of Bradford and probably never had labels and has unmarked wax capsules, but the ‘Taylor 1963’ is on the corks. The bottles are scruffy but the levels are good for age.)</em>
2008 ALZERO Cabernet Merlot Quintarelli,319.95,Alzero is local dialect for a slope, this is Cabernet Sauvignon and Franc with a touch of Merlot, like the Amarone, the fruit is dried for 2 and half months prior to pressing and fermenting, again 8 years ageing in oak prior to bottling. The aromas are typically Cabernet, tobacco, cassis and plum, but just a touch more herbal, serious and taut. On the palate there is that wonderful acidity, lots of flesh and ripe almost sweet cassis, with lovely complexing herbal notes on the long finish.
2009 AMARONE Riserva Quintarelli,559.95,NaN
2013 CHÂTEAU PÉTRUS Pomerol,1895.0,The 2013 Petrus was bottled in June 2015, a month before I visited the property to taste with winemaker, Olivier Berrouet. 
2014 NIEPOORT Late Bottled Vintage,11.95,Deep crimson. Intense dark-red fruit with deep spice, almost Christmassy in cinnamon and nutmeg. Cherries and celery salt. Finest of dry tannins, so elegant and harmonious. This is a great way to enjoy a vintage-style port without having to wait for ever. Gently chewy, velvet but with tannic structure at the core. Then dry tannic finesse on the finish. One of the most elegant LBVs I have ever tasted. (JH) 
2017 LES CARMES DE RIEUSSEC Sauternes Château Rieussec,14.95,The 2017 Carmes de Rieussec is dazzling. Here, too, the winemaking team captured a striking balance of richness and energy. Most second wines from Sauternes these days are light and floral. The Carmes has plenty of those qualities, but it is far from an easygoing Sauternes; rather it packs a serious punch. Lemon confit, passion fruit, exotic flowers and mint meld into the creamy, resonant finish.
2016 MAS AMIEL Vintage Maury Domaine Mas Amiel,15.5,Mas Amiel are rightly famous for their Vin doux naturel wines, where they arrest the fermentation with the addition of some grape spirit, leaving a wine akin to young port. This has distinct prune, molasses, woodland fruits and rich chocolate notes. The bite of tannin brings something different and makes it a great match for chocolate and macerated fruit desserts. It also works really nicely with hard cheese, grapes and nuts.
EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL Quinta da Romaneira,15.95,Lovely rich, unctuous olive oil from the Douro valley.
2017 RÉSERVE DE LÉOVILLE BARTON Saint Julien,20.95,NaN
2018 POMMARD Tavannes Domaine Fernand & Laurent Pillot,22.5,That slightly broader, sweeter richness of Pommard, sweet dense fruit picked up with lovely acidity - gorgeous, lots of punch and character.
2016 CHÂTEAU LA FLEUR DALLON Cuvée Arnaud Blaye,24.95,So well balanced and elegant on the palate, this bargain from the 'Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux' appellation is a great new arrival on the shelves at L&S. The fruit dimension shines through with notes of strawberries and cream. Given good shape by the soft, supple tannins and a neat crisp line of Bordeaux backbone - you just keep wanting to come back for another glass! Surprisingly polished effort for a Bordeaux at this price, beautifully satisfying on the finish. 
2016 CHÂTEAU GADET CUYPERS Médoc,26.95,Yet another wine from the Reich brothers (Aimée, Argenteyre), and with their characteristically engaging supple texture and lightly chewy mid-palate, allied to expressive fruit and spice notes. It's all a very happy balance, with the classical lift and straightness of good Médoc.
2016 CHÂTEAU AIMÉE Médoc,26.95,The second vintage of this for us, the 2016 Aimée follows the sleek and easily drinkable style of the 2015 with a wine that is really very similar in style. With the fresh balance and accuracy of the 2016 vintage, this is possibly even better than the 2015, with good depth of fruit, nicely-judged acidity and velvet-fine tannins. There's wood spice and even cigar-box giving an extra dimension to the cherry-plum fruit.
2015 CHÂTEAU HAUT COULOUMEY Médoc,27.75,Deep colour, rich nose, quite a solid attack, but the chewy texture is satisfyingly full of flavour, and there's spice here too.
2019 OLD HANDS Monastrell Ecológico Bodegas La Purisima,30.95,NaN
2015 MORELLINO DI SCANSANO Heba Fattoria di Magliano,34.95,Morellino is the local name for this Sangiovese clone found along the wild coast of southern Tuscany, the Maremma. Loaded with firm blackberry and black cherry fruit, nice purity and directness. Ripe with lovely bright fruit palate, cherry, blackberry and plum fruit, silky, sleek and immediate.
2015 CHÂTEAU SAINT PAUL Cru Bourgeois Médoc,38.95,Dark and with a tight thread of sophisticated ripe Cabernet, this is showing well now and holds great promise for the next three or four years, maybe more in this magnum format. A touch of salinity combined with good acidity and fine tannins add to the impression of real and grown-up Médoc panache.
2016 CHÂTEAU LA MAURIANE Puisseguin Saint Emilion,44.75,We visited the La Mauriane cellar with Pierre Taix, and tasted the 2016 in its three component cuvées as well as an approximation of the final blend. The Merlot from the chalky hillside had fantastically delicious precision, juicy, fat and supple, but above all expressive. The Merlot from the limestone plateau was grippier and more intense. The third cuvée, also from the plateau, comes from old vines - some up to 80 years old - and it has a bit of everything in it, including a vividly expressed florality and precise purple berry fruit. The final blend, with 72% Merlot, 26% Cabernet Franc and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon, is gloriously fresh and focused - and Pierre remarks that he likes it when it still have a touch of the 'sauvage', the violet aromas from the Cabernet Franc. A brilliant value bottle for 4 to 15 years time.
2012 CHÂTEAU LA MAURIANE Puisseguin Saint Emilion,49.95,85% Merlot with 15% Cabernet Franc. Rich almost plummy nose. Plump and yet not sweet, very richly full of black fruit flavour. Fleshy and goes on well. Second sample away from Chateau was oxidised on nose, but all the body and richness still there. This is the first vintage which is officially 'organic wine', a new and long fought-for designation which goes a little further than 'wine made from organically-grown grapes'.
2016 CHÂTEAU PEYMARTIN Saint Julien,59.5,The sharp-eyed will spot the trumpeting angels and the name 'Domaines Henri Martin' on the label that show that this is the second wine of Château Gloria. The heritage shows as this has a true Saint Julien silhouette, never overbearing, but still concentrated and intense, with saline minerality and mouthwatering length - a balance that has you immediately reaching for another sip.
2013 MONTETI Tenuta Monteti,63.75,Cassis, tobacco, plum and cedar, bright and fragrant, high toned but perfectly pitched. Grip and richness, gorgeous cassis and plum, lively, fresh, rich tannic structure, bold but balanced cedar, earth and tobacco, very good.
2015 MONTETI Tenuta Monteti,65.95,55% Petit Verdot, 25% Cabernet Franc, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. 18 months in medium-toasted French oak barriques (70% new and 30% of second passage). This is followed by further 24 months of bottle ageing. No fining or filtering.
2016 TASSINAIA Castello del Terriccio,67.5,NaN
2016 TIGNANELLO Marchesi Antinori,69.5,A big, lush style, this red delivers pure aromas and flavors of black currant, cherry, violet, flint, tobacco and baking spices. This is supple, yet backed by a firm, dense matrix of tannins, so all the components are there, but this needs time to integrate. Lovely sweet, ripe finish. Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. 
2014 RÉSERVE DE LÉOVILLE BARTON Saint Julien,78.5,71% Cabernet Sauvignon 25% Merlot 4% Cabernet Franc This second wine of Chateau Léoville Barton comes from young vines and plots that have not reached the high level of requirement to enter in the Grand Vin. The wine is then aged between 16 and 18 months in French oak barrels. Intense garnet color, depth and dense with a beautiful brightness. Opulent nose with spicy, peppery, roasted notes and a touch of strawberry jam. The attack is frank, ample with a beautiful tannic structure. Delicate notes of vanilla and cherry stand out in mouth 
2016 RIOJA Camino de Santa Cruz Sierra de Toloño,85.95,This wine used to be known as Rivas de Tereso and is one of Sandra's very special, small production releases from a specific old vineyard of pure Tempranillo. As before this is fermented in amphoras and then aged for one year in barrels. Incredible purity to this fabulous wine. So mineral, wafts of balsamic then black fruit berries and gorgeous fresh herbs too. For Sandra this is the optimal expression of Sierra de Toloño. Only 900 bottles produced. 
2004 CHÂTEAU LES ORMES DE PEZ Cru Bourgeois Exceptionnel Saint Estèphe,88.95,Fantastic fruit nose - very bright sweet cassis. More structured and serious than many young Ormes de Pez, roundly full in the mouth, yet keeping its freshness and expression. ‘Level of 2003’ say the Château. Fatter, sweeter and rounder than Lafon Rochet, for example, but without quite the intensity and length.
2017 CÔTE RÔTIE La Chana Domaine Benjamin et David Duclaux,92.95,2017 La Chana is a relatively new cuvee from Duclaux, an early drinking style. Made with about 7% Viognier in the blend and from 5 sites in the south of the around Tupin. 80% de-stemmed and no new oak. Bright fruits on the nice with a touch of spice, a core of fresh raspberry and black cherry, soft silky tannins, very precise and elegant, a joy to taste and drink
2016 CÔTE RÔTIE Éminence Domaine Rémi Niero,95.0,95% Syrah with 5% Viognier, from Viallière and Bassenon (Semons on the map). Dark and ripe, with fine tannins carrying concentrated flavours of damsons, blackberries and a savoury, smoky notes, a tautening background of oak. Quite intense but very sleek. This is really just getting into its stride now – but because of the vintage has oodles of charm already.
2016 CHÂTEAU JEAN FAURE Grand Cru Classé Saint Emilion,43.75,A property that is on the plateau between Cheval Blanc and l'Évangile. 50% Cabernet Franc, 50% Merlot. Supple creamy cool fruit expression - sappy and delicious black berry fruit, juicy with real grace and elegance. Beautifully done, and once again the high Cabernet Franc content giving a wine that is particularly successful this year. The property is in conversion to organic viticulture and will be certified from the 2017 vintage.
2014 CHÂTEAUNEUF DU PAPE Cuvée de la Reine des Bois Domaine de la Mordorée,103.95,Full ruby. Powerful, smoke-accented boysenberry and black raspberry on the perfumed nose. Broad and fleshy on the palate, offering bitter cherry, dark berry and licorice flavors that gain spiciness and energy with aeration. Shows very good thrust and breadth on the dark-fruit-dominated finish, which is firmed by broad, mounting tannins. In a substantial style but not lacking for vivacity.
2007 RECIOTO DELLA VALPOLICELLA Quintarelli,146.5,NaN
2014 MONTETI Tenuta Monteti,189.95,2014 is a vintage that really drove the cream to the top! Tough conditions meant that even top terroirs had to be brilliantly worked to get top quality fruit. Here at Monteti a crazy selection was carried out in the vineyard. Picking row by row and plant by plant. Over several days they brought in the very best of the vintage with 2 or 3 runs through each row harvesting. Maintaining the highest quality means they left 50% of the fruit on the ground and have a very diminished volume - but of superb quality. There is a touch more Petit Verdot this year 60% (this up 5%) with 20% Cabernet Franc and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Such great spice. Some balsamic here too. Dark fruit - rich and deep feel, some sweet meat This is impressive stuff. Brambling dark fruit, spiced and seasoned - not glossy, but really smart for 2014. Some garrigue, herbal notes too and that Petit Verdot element adds the bones. Harvesting here is so precise. Smaller berries were selected to ensure that there is structure and no dilution. Impeccable!
2006 CHÂTEAU PAVIE MACQUIN Grand Cru Classé Saint Emilion,195.0,The 2006 Château Pavie Macquin has a ripe, sensual bouquet with copious kirsch and blueberry scents, fine tension and poise, a faint whiff of boot polish in the background. The palate is very elegant on the entry, pure and supple in the mouth, succulent with vivid black cherry and dark plum notes. It is that keen line of acidity cutting through the fruit that takes this Saint Emilion to a higher level and it comes highly recommended. Tasted February 2016.
2012 CHÂTEAU GLORIA Cru Bourgeois Saint Julien,235.0,Plush and rounded, lively and winning with a good mid-palate feel and the quite evident oak is attractive rather than overpowering.
2011 CLOS DES LAMBRAYS Grand Cru Domaine des Lambrays,332.95,Rich nose of deep fruit and undergrowth. A huge volume of wine. Rich and suave and pure. Furry with fine ripe tannin, it all builds beautifully, very harmonious, and yet still urgent, lively, brisk. A little bit of liquorice and spice. But it's the harmony that stands out.
2018 CAPELLANA Blanco Bodegas Nodus,7.95,100% Macabeu from the historic “Finca El Renegado” vineyards, the oldest part of Bodegas Nodus estate. The vines are approximately 800 metres above sea level in the beautiful area surrounding the town of ‘Caudete de las Fuentes’. Pale yellow in colour; aromas of fresh citrus with hints of apple and pear with gentle mineral undertones. A very fresh and crisp palate with pineapple, citrus, pear and hints of white flowers.
2017 MACABEO Las Corazas Bodegas Roqueta,7.95,A super value dry white from Castella y Leon. 100% Macabeo (Viura), cold fermented to maximise freshness and clean fruit. 
2019 CAMINA Chardonnay-Viura,8.5,Another fabulous value fresh White from Spain. Our hunting here has been really fruitful at this end of the price spectrum. This is a lively uncomplicated blend, ideal for quaffing. Notes of Melon, some delicate citrus pep, and a gently soft feel, it is super refreshing and won't break the bank.
2019 SAUVIGNON-VERMENTINO Domaine Saint Félix,8.5,A Sauvignon Blanc and Vermentino blend from vineyards facing the town of Narbonne and the sea. Plentiful sunshine imbues the wine with lots of fruit, crunchy gooseberry from the Sauvignon and a broader more floral note from the Vermentino. A good all-rounder that will work well for light suppers, fish and salads.
2019 VINHO VERDE Espigueiro Casa Agricola de Compostela,8.95,This 2019 medium lemon gem Vinho Verde from Casa Agricola is both light in body and alcohol, with subtle lemon and tangerine notes on the nose. The palate follows through with additional refreshing notes of green apple, with a highly acidic finish, along with the characteristic spritz, so typical in Vinho Verde. This occurs during the fermentation process. This style of wine is perfect on it's own on a warm summer's evening, and you can picture the rolling hills of Northern Portugal whilst you sip. It really does wet your appetite and the perfect aperitif! The region is in Northern Portugal, north west of Porto and is influenced climatically by the Atlantic Ocean to the west. 
2019 'CHAVAL' BLANCO Bodegas Nodus,8.5,Chaval is the local Valencia name for a 'youngster' and the Chaval Blanco is the most fun and carefree of the whites from this great Finca. An organic Chardonnay Moscatel blend from Valencia. Bright floral soft fruit, hints of crisp apple and some ripe pear notes. Easy but with lots going on to keep you coming back for more.
2018 INDABA WESTERN CAPE Chenin Blanc,8.95,Brilliantly made Chenin Blanc from the Western Cape. All about freshness here, with no oak whatsoever. Citrus and green apple on the nose that continues on the palate. For the price, this wine certainly over delivers. Lots of texture to the fruit, very well balanced with incredible racy acidity. A lovely wine that will pair well with or without food.
2019 SAUVIGNON BLANC Domaine de Valensac,9.95,NaN
2019 CHARDONNAY Domaine de Valensac,9.95,Supremely consistent Chardonnay from the Languedoc. Fresh and easy going with peach, melon and a creamy buttery edge, it refreshes and entertains with it's breezy style. Great by itself or with fish and white meats.
2019 OLD HANDS BLANCO Sauvignon Ecológico Bodegas La Purisima,9.5,NaN
2019 PINOT GRIGIO Delle Venezie Cantina Valdadige,10.95,A well-made Pinot Grigio with ripe pear and apple fruit. Hints of peach on the palate with good acidity on the finish.
2019 PICPOUL DE PINET Domaine Reine Juliette,11.5,If you’ve given up on picpoul because cheaper versions have become insipid, try this, it’s brilliant: whistle-clean; saline, like your skin after a sea swim; reminiscent of crushed rocks and faint white blossom. Try with seafood. 
2019 BASCAND ESTATE Sauvignon Blanc,NaN,NaN
2018 PINOT GRIGIO Vina Laguna,11.95,Fabulous Pinot Grigio with a bit of character! From the very 'Italian' Istrian peninsula in Croatia. Just over the border from Venice. Soft, fleshy fruit, a touch of brightening salinity and fresh acidity. Very good all-round drinking and a real bargain!
2018 MALVASIA Festigia Vina Laguna,11.95,Light and refreshing dry white from the Istrian Peninsular. Clean and crisp with gentle citrus tones.
2019 PINOT GRIGIO Vina Laguna,11.95,Proper Pinot Grigio, from vineyards in Istria, just across the Adriatic from Venice. Pear, peach and some nice peppery spice, this has just the right amount of fruit and acidity, giving a wine of lovely balance.
2019 MACABEO Écologico Bodegaverde,11.95,We ended up tasting these wines after quite some line up of new wines and wowsers did they stand up well. Macabeo can sometimes be a little, shall we say, dull, but this version is nothing of the sort. Fresh and with great intensity on the nose of greengage, chamomile, fresh hay and delicate citrus. The palate is deliciously intense with yellow fruits, wild flowers, fragrant herbs and a bounce of juicy fresh acidity. A quite brilliant everyday white.
PROSECCO TREVISO Spumante Brut il Follo Prosecco,11.95,Bright fresh and zippy with rich citrus, peach and white flowers, palate has nice intensity with Apple, lemon and peach fruit, crisp and lively, decent mousse, good length.
2019 RUSTENBERG Sauvignon Blanc,11.95,The grapes for this were hand-picked in February 2019. Crushed, de-stemmed & pressed, then fermented in stainless steel. Aged for 2-3 months on the lees. The intrinsic Sauvignon Blanc characteristics of tropical fruits, melon and gooseberry, with underlying tones of pineapple and passion fruit sustained on a fresh, crisp and well-balanced palate with prodigious length.
2019 GRÜNER VELTLINER Klassik Artner,11.95,Carnuntum is a very celebrated region within Austria for fine wine production. We are delighted to have met the Artner family who make this brilliant, bright Grüner here. Delicious, pithy green citrus notes hold forth on the attack - and are echoed with a gentle pep on the tongue. Delightfully juicy. And yet there is depth too, perfumed with superb texture. A great new addition to our list. Fresh, but far from simple.
PROSECCO Caposaldo Brut Antonio Fattori,12.5,Lovely precision and drive for this Prosecco, good fruit delivery, peach and ripe pear but with a vivacious, mouthwatering bright acidity. This makes it refreshing and hugely drinkable.
2018 BLANC DE MER Bouchard Finlayson,11.95,Bouchard Finlayson's delightful blend, is light and easy, so instantly attractive and a joy to drink with stronger fish dishes or even Oriental flavours, or fresh enough to have just on its own with good company. The blend is mostly Riesling, with Viognier, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc and a drop of Semillon. A gentle floral edge to the nicely winey bouquet is followed by quince and apricot fruit characters on the pleasantly generous palate, all finished with a nice refreshing dry finish
2019 TOURAINE LES SAUTERELLES Domaine de Pierre, Lionel Gosseaume,12.5,Lionel continues to produce fabulous value Sauvignon and the 2019 is another cracker. Slightly fuller fruited than Sancerre, with ripe gooseberry and citrus, some lovely herbal touches and a bright lifted acidity making it truly refreshing.
2019 GRILLO Le Casematte,12.95,Aromatic, preserved lemon, peach fruit, palate is richly textured, stone fruit, quince and aromatic pear, still good acid weight and length.
2019 GRENACHE BLANC-VIOGNIER Champs des Lys Domaine La Croix Belle,12.95,NaN
2020 RUSTENBERG Roussanne,12.5,NaN
2018 GRECO DI MATERA Le Paglie DOC Battifarano,13.5,Before being reclaimed from the sea in the 1950s the 'Paglie di Battifarano' was damp marshland - but now is the heart of the family's white wine vineyards. This pure Greco is fantastic. Brightly aromatic with good spice and kick. On the palate there is nice intensity and a notable weight of fruit, but great crisp acidity underpins this deep slab. The profile is fresh, some lemon, some pineapple and that soft ginger note once again. Delicious and completely charming wine which will make a great aperitivo or pair happily with fresher summer suppers. 
2019 TR Sauvignon Blanc Two Rivers of Marlborough,13.5,Absolutely nothing is left out of this little cracker. When you consider it is the baby brother of the Convergence, it shares so much of that DNA. Brightly tropical aromatics of Papaya, mango and gooseberry. The palate is bright fresh and imbued with lovely juicy lift and poise, absolutely delicious.
2019 SOAVE CLASSICO Montesei Le Battistelle,13.5,Bright and clean Soave that totally delivers. Crisp but with no hard edges - no brisk acidity, just a great texture and clean mineral flow. There is no wood used here - but the juice stays on the lees for about 4 months and with this perfect fruit from the domaine's south facing vineyards there is an ample feel and deliciously tangible flesh. But no fatness. The fruit is lovely, soft citrus and some blossomy floral notes. There is some firmer pear and a crunch of apple too, which adds a lift and keeps the flow bubbling along perfectly. Delicious and so moreish. The perfect aperitivo or partner for any fresh dish.
2018 RIESLING Trocken Qba Weingut Lehnert-Veit,13.5,NaN
2017 MUSCADET SÈVRE ET MAINE VIEILLES VIGNES Sur Lie Domaine Bruno Cormerais,13.5,A wonderfully characterful style from Bruno Cormerais, hints of fennel and tarragon run throughout this wine. Thrillingly pure and crisp, with tangy citrus fruit, it is quenching and enticing in equal measure. A perfect match for a seafood platter.
2019 SUAVIS Vernaccia Di San Gimignano Mormoraia,13.5,As ever this is super value from San Gimignano. The name Suavis means 'succulent and tasty' - and it is very appropriate here! Entirely organically cultivated Vernaccia, it is chock-full of pithy pear, citrus and almond flowers. Notes of firm white fruit flesh, and a satisfying weight all kept on track, flowing nicely with just a gentle bite of juicy acidity.
2019 GRÜNER VELTLINER Hochterrassen Salomon Undhof,13.95,A refreshing Grüner with lightly peppery white fruit on the nose, bright with citrus and stone in the mouth, and an elegantly clean dry mineral dusted finish. A perfect introduction to the dry Grüner Veltliners from Bert Salomon.
2019 MANTINIA Moropoulous,13.95,To say we are excited about having our very own Greek white is an understatement, we are beside ourselves about this beauty. Fragrant with notes of grapefruit, lime and honeysuckle. In the mouth there is a delicious pithy note, delicately saline and chalky, packed with citrus and orange pekoe. A joyous mouthful that would accompany the freshest seafood and salads perfectly.
2019 MÂCON VILLAGES Domaine de la Denante,13.95,Creamy, bright fruited style, citrus, acacia, palate is supple and easy going, some richness, decent acid, peach and touch of creaminess on the finish.
2018 KUMEU 'VILLAGE' Chardonnay Kumeu River,13.95,Hand-harvested, with around 25% of fruit from Hawke's Bay, made in a combination of stainless steel and older barrels, whole-bunch pressed. Creamy, a touch of oatmeal and spice, creamy apple, but fresh. Crisp and a touch of exotic fruit comes through.
2019 LEA & SANDEMAN White Burgundy Bourgogne Blanc,13.95,NaN
CRÉMANT DE LOIRE Brut Domaine des Hauts Perrays,NaN,From a small family-run Domaine in the heart of Chenin Blanc territory, (Coteaux du Layon) this is a beautifully crafted Crémant de Loire. Traditionally made (bottle-fermented) sparkling wine which is vinified from a large proportion of Chenin Blanc, with some Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc - all grown on a mix of schist, clay, and quartz. 
2018 BOURGOGNE BLANC 'Escargot' Damien Martin,14.5,This cracking Bourgogne Blanc from Damian Martin is a wonderfully unassuming linen fresh, peach and melon wonder. Just the right balance of pure fruit and bright acidity with a creamy undertow on the finish.
2019 FRIULANO Friuli Colli Orientali Azienda Agricola Visintini,14.5,NaN
2019 VIOGNIER L'Invité Domaine des Trinités,NaN,Pale and clean as a whistle in the glass. Green hue but bright. Nose is pretty and floral aromatics abound, white sprays of blossom. There is trademark viognier notes of apricot and some intense ripe peach notes too which underpin the more breezy, pretty and delicate bouquet. Once again palate is bright and juicy. Firm white stone fruit, some pear. Quite exhilarating for Viognier. Texture is good. Peppy but sleek feel. Bright juicy acidity comes together beautifully on the finish and the sensation is of a polished, harmonious and seriously satisfying white.
2019 ROUSSANNE L'Imaginaire Domaine des Trinités,14.5,Made by Simon Coulshaw of the minimal intervention philosophy. Biodynamic farming although not certified. 100% Roussanne planted on their highest vineyards – a steep north-facing slope in the foothills of the Cévennes mountains. Isolated vineyards surrounded by herbaceous shrub and woodland on schist and basalt boulders. Hand-picked at 20–25 hl/ha, Five days' on skins then 48 hours of cold settling before racking. Spontaneous fermentation, no enzymes, no fining, minimal sulphur and sulphites. Carbon dioxide nap used to avoid oxidation. Smells of mimosa and cold pebbles. So tight it's as if the fruit has been hot-waxed onto the palate. Wild, wild fruit and flowers, all hedgerow and fields. Iodine and salt, dust and dry bricks, saffron and yuzu. So much texture it's like licking chalk-dusted rose petals. Fascinating wine, that changes as you sit with it, like sunset dropped into a kaleidoscope, like light on water. Masses of undertow, savoury and sweet. Lea & Sandeman used to import this. I wish they still did! (AND WE DO!)
2019 MÂCON VINZELLES Cave des Grands Crus Blancs,13.95,NaN
2019 PINOT GRIGIO Ramato Friuli Colli Orientali Azienda Agricola Visintini,14.95,This is a wine that creeps up on you and wraps itself around your taste buds with such a seductive style. Notes of pear and peach, white flowers and just a hint of chamomile. The palate is ripe but not heavy, layered with stone fruit and an edge of subtly spiced pear, then a bright acid balance. With it's gently bronzy pink colour and mouthfilling complexity it is a great wine for all seasons.
2019 RIBOLLA GIALLA Friuli Colli Orientali Azienda Agricola Visintini,14.95,NaN
2018 SCHIEFER Riesling Trocken Qba Weingut Lehnert-Veit,14.95,From slate soils, as the name says, and it has a mineral lift and firmness. Floral aromatics and a bright juicy nectarine or white currant fruit. Quite dry, it has a fairly lemony acidity and a stony slick finish.
2019 SCHIEFER Riesling Trocken Qba Weingut Lehnert-Veit,14.95,This stunner from the Mosel valley has a racy acidity that makes the mouth water, with notes of green apple and stone fruits. This would perfectly accompany spicy Asian dishes or indeed act as a refreshing aperitif.
2019 DRY FURMINT Disznókő,14.5,Pale yellow with the greenish tint typical of the Furmint grape. Fresh and aromatic with hints of white flowers and grapefruit. A palate of exotic fruits with pear and quince followed by a lingering mineral, salty finish. Refreshingly elegant.
2019 CONVERGENCE Sauvignon Blanc Two Rivers of Marlborough,14.95,An abundance of bell pepper, fennel and crushed tomato leaf aromas mingle with subtle notes of tangelo, snow pea and nettle. Dry and saline, the flinty yet lively palate has a lovely creamy texture and a juicy smooth finish.
NIEPOORT Dry White,14.95,Delicious, rich but balanced an intense style of White Port beautifully made this makes a wonderful aperitif - As featured by Kate Goodman on the BBC Food and Drink programme Monday, 11th March, 2013.
2018 ABOLENGO Chardonnay Cachapoal Valley,15.5,Cool air from the Andes Mountains in the southern winegrowing region of Lontué, provides the perfect, cool climate for growing Chardonnay in this beautiful part of Chile. This is filled with ripe peach and subtle tropical fruit, that makes you aware that you are in the southern hemisphere, but then cuts through with a lovely brightness and poise not unlike something from the Maconnais. Really well made with a delicate nutty richness, it enriches and refreshes in equal measure.
2018 PÁRAMOS DE NICASIA WHITE Verdejo Màquina y Tabla,15.95,After 2017 Oriol had a given himself a tough act to follow, but he has certainly done it with this sensational 2018. Put simply, it's Verdejo, but not as you know it. The addition of Malvasia makes this incredibly complex and intriguing. Lots of rich spiced appley fruit but with a bright, citrus sway too. The weight on the palate is sensational. Broad and sweeping but clean as a whistle. An intriguing delight. Layers and layers of interest here - the type of wine where you pick up more and more aromas and flavours with each and every sip.
2018 LADERAS DE LEONILA WHITE Màquina y Tabla,15.95,Once again this exhilarating white is a blend of 50% Doña Blanca (Portugal's Síria), 15% Godello and 35% Palomino all barrel-fermented and then aged for 12 months in old French barriques with the Palomino element spending time under flor. This gives that toasty, smoky, yeasty character that reminds one of Fino Sherry in a very enticing way. Loaded with delicious quince and crunchy apricot fruit, soft ginger and a remarkably bright edge that plays really well with the saline freshness. Each mouthful is a journey - this contemplative white is a thrill and a treat and simply delicious to drink with some crunchy snacks or salted almonds.
2019 GAVI Etichetta Bianca Tenuta la Marchesa,15.95,One of those wines that is quite shy in it's personality, but this doesn't stop it being an intriguing glass of white. A lean pure citrus style, it has a clean minerality that makes it incredibly refreshing. Great with oysters, white fish and vegetable risotto.
2018 PIESPORTER GÜNTERSLAY Riesling Trocken Weingut Lehnert-Veit,NaN,Gunterslay is right up at the top pf the slope at 220m, just below the forest, and on pure Devonian slate gravels. The poor soil and altitude make for a light and mineral expression, dry and both delicate and intense.
2018 RIESLING Domaine Schoenheitz,15.95,NaN
2019 VERDICCHIO CLASSICO SUPERIORE Classico Superiore dei Castelli di Jesi Andrea Felici,15.95,NaN
2018 SAINT VÉRAN Domaine de la Denante,16.95,Young Damien Martin is making the smartest wines of his life. This Saint Veran is one of the best values you can find in Burgundy. The 2018 has a lovely suppleness, an indulgent weight that you'd expect from the long, warm season. Yet this never feels too big. Nicely checked and balanced with a fresh citrus line picking up the softer yellow flesh and apple crunch. There's gentle spice too. This is satisfying and sleek with ample shape and gentle push. A very pleasing white Burgundy at a really pleasing price.
2019 PAGLIATURA Vermentino della Maremma Toscana Fattoria di Magliano,NaN,Magliano's pure Vermentino is always a joy, it really does express the beautiful coastal vineyards of this brilliant estate. Fresh peach and nectarine fruits abound, with honeysuckle and jasmine fragrance, fresh with a lively acid balance on the finish.
2019 GRECHETTO Tenuta di Salviano,16.95,We love this new find from the brilliant Incisa della Rochettas at their beautiful Umbrian outpost. The 2019 Grechetto is nicely textured. Quite deep and quite densely packed with white flowers and firm white-fleshed fruit. Some savoury notes too and a pleasing line of fresh minerality. Not quite as richly loaded at this early stage as the 2018 was - much prettier with more bounce. Smart stuff and totally delicious drawing to mind long lunches under the Italian sun...
2019 MIP* COLLECTION Premium White,16.95,A fuller version than the Classic white, still fragrant, but just that bit punchier, more citrus intensity, some nice melon flesh in the mouth, never overwhelming with wild flowers and a touch of camomile. Think grilled sea bream or trout 'en papillote' as the perfect accompaniment.
2018 GEWURZTRAMINER Wihr-au-Val Domaine Schoenheitz,16.95,Classic Gewurz: straw-yellow, rose petals and spice on the nose, a hint of sweetness mid-palate with tropical fruit and spice, and a fine acidity giving balance to the finish.
2018 ACÚSTIC BLANC Acústic Celler,17.5,Albert's Acustic blanc is always a textural masterpiece, with it's quince, pear and honey notes, it has quite a rich textural feel in the mouth, but is always balanced with a delicious ripe acidity.
2019 LANGHE ARNEIS Barale Fratelli,16.95,This shows the typical nutty fresh almond note of good Arneis on both the nose and palate that make this such an intriguing style. Wild flowers and citrus fruits abound with a lovely textural weight to the palate and that nutty intensity to the broad finish. Bring on the Bagna Cauda!
2019 GEWURZTRAMINER Wihr-au-Val Domaine Schoenheitz,17.5,NaN
2019 GAVI Etichetta Oro Tenuta la Marchesa,17.5,NaN
2019 RIESLING Traditionale Pikes Polish Hill River Estate,17.5,I always find it easy to write tasting notes for the great, dry Rieslings from Pikes and this 2019 is a top-class example of their epic, lime pith-imbued, insanely tight and resonant wines. These are electrifying brilliant whites which drink brilliantly in their youth and age gracefully, too. If you have yet to taste Pikes Riesling then you are in for a treat as they are so fine and so long. The only difficulty I encounter when writing about these wines is typing the price – it seems so incongruous that such a stellar creation has such a ubiquitous price point. 
2019 BACCHUS Dry White English wine Winbirri Vineyards,16.95,From the multi-award winning Winbirri vineyard in Norfolk. This is quite simply the best Bacchus we have ever tasted from anywhere in the UK. Winbirri means wine meadow in Anglo Saxon, so you can see this area has a viticultural heritage. Lee Dyer has definitely taken full advantage of this wonderfully clement spot. Year after year he produces beautifully fragrant, tangy, bright wines. This has elderflower, citrus and grapefruit on the nose, in the mouth it is sleek and fresh, gooseberry, elderflower and a touch slatey on the finish.
2019 POUILLY FUMÉ Domaine Hervé Séguin,17.95,NaN
2019 BOURGOGNE ALIGOTÉ Domaine Paul et Marie Jacqueson,17.95,This comes from the old vines that Marie's grandfather planted between 1966 and 1950 when he started the domaine. Like the Bouzeron this is 'Aligoté doré', and there's that lovely weighty calm of very old vines, sunnily ripe and still with Aligoté zip.
2019 PELORO Bianco Le Casematte,17.95,A little less exuberant than the straight Grillo. Fine lemon and mandarin fruit. Long and linear. 
2019 ESTATE RESERVE Chardonnay Glenelly Estate,17.95,NaN
2018 MÂCON CHAINTRÉ Pierres Polies Domaine Daniel Barraud,18.75,Nicely sleek and broad in feel. Fruit is tense here - deeply flavoured with pineapple - savoury ginger powder. As ever this is a pert and firm and remarkably joyful Macon. A really nice, pretty, bright lift runs through this.
2018 BOURGOGNE ALIGOTÉ Domaine Dureuil-Janthial,18.75,Lively bright and so pure - a lemony briskness crystalline definition. 
2019 MOFETE ETNA BIANCO Palmento Costanzo,19.5,70% Carricante 30% Catarratto. Medium straw yellow. Fruity and flowery at the nose, with yellow citrus pulp, balsamic and mineral hints. Fresh, long, insinuating and structured in mouth.
2019 ANJOU Blanc Château de Plaisance,19.5,Such delicious Chenin, giving plenty of peach, honey and warm straw notes. The weight is superb and this is made in a slightly easier going style, the fruit is more open, fleshy, but backed by Chenin's tell-tale fresh lively acidity.
2018 CHABLIS Domaine Adhémar et Francis Boudin,19.95,In such a warm vintage the Boudin family have done a great job here presenting a fresh and nicely clipped Chablis. As ever their trademark soft fruit and weight is in there but delivered brightly and with good verve, another very pleasing release from this house favourite.
FRANCIACORTA Brut Corteaura,19.95,Lovely biscuity, ripe fruit nose with citrus and yellow plum notes. On the palate the wine is generous with plenty of ripe fruit, touch creamy, waft of fresh bread, then a lovely mouthwatering acidity giving excellent length and balance. 100 per cent Chardonnay, so think Blanc de Blancs. 
2018 GRÜNER VELTLINER ESTATE Illahe Vineyards,19.95,We destem and crush the grüner and do a 24 hour cold soak on the skins with some stem inclusion to increase aromatics. After a gentle pressing we then ferment 30% of the juice in acacia barrels to increase texture and mouthfeel and the remainder in stainless. The 2018 Grüner Veltliner has aromas of pear, fleshy peach, honeycomb, rice cracker, and straw. The palate continues with honeydew melon, guava, jojoba flower, fresh cut grass, coconut, and homemade marshmallow, with a classic white pepper finish.
2018 PINOT GRIS Illahe Vineyards,19.95,The 2018 Illahe pinot gris is layered with complex fruit and starts with notes of crisp granny smith apple, bright lemon zest, and hints of clove, paired with light notes of papaya and starfruit. Part of the fruit from the 2018 pinot gris is from our estate vineyard and part is from our neighbors at Erratic Oaks Vineyard. Both sites are heavily influenced by the Mount Pisgah weather patterns and soil structures. It is also influenced by the neutral oak it is vinified in, which adds creaminess and texture with lingering flavors of almond butter and a spicy finish of cardamom creates an exciting and flavorful wine that is sure to leave you wanting more.
2018 CHÂTEAU DE CÉRONS Blanc Graves,19.95,Clean and quite zingy, lifted with mouth-watering freshness, some grassy-edged fruit and lashings of pert grapefruit that lead to a neat finish This gorgeous white Bordeaux comes from vineyards made up of gravel and seashells. Classic Graves terroir and perfectly suited to the Sémillon and 2 Sauvignons they grow here. In 2018 this is close to Caroline's ideal blend: 60% Sémillon, 30% Sauvignon Blanc & 10% Sauvignon Gris. The wine has a gorgeous texture, a powdery clean feel and good drive for 2018. No oak is used this spends a good stretch ageing in steel on the lees though - you can feel it. Delicious.
2019 ZUANI Vigne Bianco Collio,19.95,NaN
2018 GRAN AUTÒCTON BLANC Autòcton Celler,19.95,NaN
2019 RIESLING Eden Valley Tim Smith Wines,20.5,Sourced from a single vineyard in Eden Valley, nearly 100 years of age. No spectacular secret winemaking here: Whole bunch pressed to tank, cold settled, and then racked to ferment with a cultured yeast. Bottled early to preserve freshness.
2018 ALSACE Domaine Marcel Deiss,20.5,The vineyards for this wine are in bio-dynamic conversion, but not yet certified. Classic blend using thirteen different Alsace grape varieties, grown on the limestone and clay soils of Bergheim. Gently pressed and vinified without any additions, the Alsace is a great introduction to the Deiss style and the concept of different grapes grown, picked and fermented together to produce a complex wine which expresses its origins.
2018 CHABLIS Domaine des Hâtes,20.95,Massive yields of 2018 here in Chablis mean that all producers have to get rid of anything more than 60HL/HA harvested. Inevitably they get rid of the excess from the bottom up. This means the great quality filters down: - excess Grand Cru juice goes into 1er Cru, excess 1er cru goes in to Chablis etc. Which helps explain why this is quite so good. Nice and clean core of sleek fruit dominates proceedings. There is a good peppy acidity too which carries nicely the full and supple fruit. All really well delivered in a polished neat jolt - well done Pierrick this is great drinkers' Chablis. 
2019 LE G DE GUIRAUD Bordeaux Blanc Château Guiraud,20.95,These are always enticing and ultimately rewarding wines to drink and the 2019, the result of a slightly warmer yet balanced vintage, is no exception. In fact that extra touch of ripeness pushes forward the ripe citrus, nectarine and fragrant grapefruit notes that abound on the nose and palate, but that isn't to the detriment of balance and freshness. In fact good dry white Bordeaux can age nicely and provide great drinking for 10 years or more and this wine will do just that.
2019 RIESLING Ried Kögl Salomon Undhof,20.95,Christmas note: <br>Thoroughly satisfying dry, full-bodied Riesling with notes of lime and flowers that would pair particularly well with fish, raw or smoked. A good price. Full note: <Br> Particularly bright fruit on the nose, which is still very much evolving. Really well chiselled on the palate. A particularly precise Riesling with breadth on the palate and notes of lime and a floral note on the finish. Classic dry Riesling with real vibrancy and ageing potential. By no means overpriced.
2019 RIPPON Sauvignon Blanc,21.5,A restrained Sauvignon Blanc that's part fermented (50%) in old French barrels, adding texture and rounding the variety's natural edges. As a result, it's a supple yet delicate wine bursting with masses of mouthwatering acidity. Expect precise but understated aromas of freshly cut grass, green capsicum and a delicate, floral note with the merest hint of lees-derived pastry character emerging on the medium-length finish.
2019 GRUNER VELTLINER Wachtberg DAC Erste Lage Salomon Undhof,21.5,NaN
2019 KRATOS Fiano Luigi Maffini,21.95,Another stunner from Luigi. This pure Fiano is the best expression of this lively, textured variety we have found. Perfumed and fresh with peach and apricot, wild flowers, touch of lime. Palate is zesty with lime juice, peach flesh A satisfying Mineral line, crisp acidity - but generous fruit extract. Gently perfumed and very satisfying. This is now the fifth vintage that is certified Organic.
2016 RIESLING Linsenberg Domaine Schoenheitz,21.95,Bold and beautifully textural, intense lime, kerosene and peach skin. Very pure and expressive on the palate, layered mineral, lime and fleshy stone fruit, bright acid, sleek and juicily refreshing.
2019 BOURGOGNE Cuvée Selection Domaine Paul et Marie Jacqueson,21.95,They buy the fruit for this from Pierreclos. It's very well done, with a fresh succulence and evidence of the really top-notch élevage in old barrels which round out the edges and draw out the length, emphasising the elegance. Good acidity on the finish.
2018 KERNER Manni Nössing,22.5,The 2018 vintage is our third from Manni Nossing and this is another masterclass in power and finesse. There are only 25ha of Kerner, a cross between Riesling and Schiava Grosso in Italy and Manni is a shining light with this delicious variety. The 2018 is crystalline pure. Firm pear and a waft of tightly budded white flowers are at the core here with nice texture and a chablis-like weight. A delicious balance of drive and soft comforting texture, clever stuff and delicious drinking.
2018 SYLVANER Manni Nössing,22.5,Regarded as a cult classic in Italy and capable of ageing nicely for quite a few years. This has notes of peppery herb, lemon and wild flowers. Shapely and sleek it has good weight and a lovely lip smacking freshness. These wines come highly recommended.
2019 RONCERAY Anjou Blanc Château de Plaisance,NaN,The name Ronceray refers to the abbey that once owned Quarts de Chaume, and it has become a name that all producers making dry wine here intend to use on a communal basis, at least until Quarts de Chaume can legally exist in this dry guise. This super site so prized for years as a source for sweet Chenin is having a marvellous re-invention as an exciting spot for producing Chenin in its dry form. The results are sublime and this first vintage for Vanessa from some lovely old vines is a triumph. At once reassuringly textured with ample feel and breadth - but dry as a bone and with a lovely tight line of brisk freshness running right through it. Soft, happy and desperately moreish. This is a lovely 'step-up' in complexity and intensity from her delicious Anjou Blanc.
2015 TONGUE IN GROOVE Riesling,22.75,Effusively declared by Tongue in Groove MD Angela Clifford as 'probably the best Riesling we've ever made'. Drier than the 2013 vintage with only 6 g/l residual sugar, this a refined vintage of the trademark Tongue in Groove style. 
2019 ALMA Riesling Salomon Undhof,22.95,NaN
2019 BOUZERON Les Cordères Domaine Paul et Marie Jacqueson,22.95,Excellent Aligoté from the only village with an appellation for it - this is sleek and textured, very attractive, should open up more over it's first six or twelve months.
2019 SANCERRE Chavignol Domaine Vincent Delaporte,22.95,As ever this is beautifully fresh, a lovely citrus tang and salty zip at the outset but it is the weight of perky fruit that fills out the middle and drives this on, making it so much more impressive than almost anyone else achieves in the appellation. The Delaporte vines are all in Chavignol - the undisputed top spot for Sancerre. With rolling hills more reminiscent of the Cote d'Or than the ubiquitous plains of the Loire valley it is no surprise that the quality is so much higher here.
2016 MUSCAT DE MAS AMIEL Domaine Mas Amiel,23.5,From the kings of Roussillon dessert wines, candied peel of orange and lemon, some floral touches, honey and barley sugar. Good acidity, lots of rich fruit, zesty, pithy, with lots of character and richness.
2019 VIOGNIER Les Gendrines Côtes du Rhône Domaine Pierre Gaillard,NaN,Fresh floral notes in abundance, such a charming wine for Cotes du Rhone, full of energy, apricot, touch of peach, lots of freshness and very drinkable
2018 MAS VILELLA BLANC Autòcton Celler,24.5,From a single vineyard of 100% Malvasia de Sitges. The soil is very poor stony, calcareous clay mix, at 250 metres of altitude and just 15 km away from the Mediterranean. Fermented and aged on the lees in a blend of Big French oak barrels and clay amphora for 10 months. It is a deep, concentrated and powerful wine, with lovely deep green fruit flesh and some nicely spiced floral notes. Albert tells us the potential for ageing is great - but there is much to love already drinking now on the juicy fruit. 
2017 COTEAUX DU LAYON CHAUME 1er Cru Château de Plaisance,24.5,This is a wonderful bargain, filled with stewed apples and pears, some honeyed notes and then just a touch of caramel. In the mouth there is plenty of richly layered fruit, with just enough acidity to balance the depth of sweetness that flows through on the finish.
2018 ZELLENBERG Domaine Marcel Deiss,24.95,NaN
2019 RIESLING 'The Merle' Pikes Polish Hill River Estate,24.95,NaN
2018 CROZES HERMITAGE BLANC La Fille Dont J'ai Rêvé Domaine Gaylord Machon,24.95,70% Roussanne 30% Marsanne.
2017 RIQUEWIHR Domaine Marcel Deiss,25.5,The Riquewhir is quite capricious, at times breezily fresh and easy going and then quite serious and straight. This settles in the glass and evolves nicely into a wine with plenty of spiced pear, peach and creamy honey, but always with a backbone of pure lithe acidity. This makes it a lot of fun to drink and as in with every sip you'll find a subtle change of character that holds your interest tightly, right to the end of the bottle.
FRANCIACORTA Pas Dosé Brut Corteaura,24.95,Enticing aromas of toast, butter, ripe apple, citrus and nut. The palate is pure and crisp with complex layered, citrus, nut, bread and malt notes, all finished off with a brisk bright acidity that gives great length. Smart champagne blend of 80% Chardonnay, 20% Pinot Noir. This spends 50 months on the lees in the cellar. 
2017 PIETRABIANCA Castel del Monte Tormaresca,24.95,Antinori’s Puglian outpost makes this appetising Chardonnay and Fiano blend. Chardonnay dominates heavily. There is a broad and sweeping feel with some fun brighter more saline notes too. This is sunny chardonnay but thankfully retains good shape and drive. Smartly done. Nicely spiced and quite impressive. Relatively impressive value here from this esteemed producer.
2019 RIPPON 'Rippon' Mature Vine Riesling,25.95,Like many wines made by Nick Mills at Rippon, this needs time to reveal its true character. This is an attractive Riesling with silken texture, but it is a quiet wine that requires exploration. Expect subtle yet stimulating floral aromas, and apple and lemon peel allied with brioche-like notes from time on lees playing a supporting role. New Zealand Riesling can be austere due to its acidity, but Mills has found a happy medium between acidity and sweetness, leaving a dry, clean, balanced finish.
2019 RIPPON Gewurztraminer,25.95,This reined-in Gewürztraminer offers a medley of fruit flavors and rose petals. While there's the merest hint of sweetness (8g/L) adding some flesh to the midpalate, the bright acidity keeps proceedings clean and dry. An attractive, mouth-coating framework of phenolics and acidity provides a precise, textured finish. If there were more Gewürztraminer made like this, the world would drink a whole lot more of it.
2018 BOURGOGNE BLANC Rémi Jobard,25.5,Picked on the 11th and 12th of September, after all of the domaine wines, this is Rémi's one wine made from bought fruit. Citrus peel phenolics, bright and pure, with nice bouncy acidity.
2018 FIRST FLIGHT Viognier Domaine G&J Bott,24.95,This bright, pure Viognier comes from plots high up above Ampuis. It has a freshness to it that is hard to resist. Clearly Viognier, but miles from the heavy, fat Peachy style which is all too common here. This is nicely aromatic but more in the feel of Malvasia. Early picking and sensitive work in the cellar is the key - and it unlocks this juicy white that you can enjoy on its own or happily with food too. Grilled chicken or mild curries - gently spiced noodles too would be great partners. 
2019 RULLY Domaine Paul et Marie Jacqueson,25.75,A very full example for the appellation, this has a rich and weighty middle, still with good acidity, especially on the finish.
2016 GEWURZTRAMINER Domaine Marcel Deiss,25.95,The hedonistic, all conquering, look-at-me, unsophisticated 'charm' of Gewürztraminer catches us all at one time or another but rarely do we linger long in the lychee and rose psychedelia of this extraordinary variety. You owe yourself a revisit to the day-glo side if only to try Jean-Michel Deiss' handling of the beast. Of course, it exudes scent and flamboyance, but there is some semblance of balance and complexity with the Deiss that eludes most/all others. 
2018 BIANCO DI SEI Etna Bianco Palmento Costanzo,25.95,Almond shells, with a neutral, restrained, chalky character. Liquid stones on the palate. Closed and tense. Decent length though. 
2016 BERCKEM Domaine Marcel Deiss,26.5,The Berckem is without doubt the richest and sweetest in the mouth, although at 15gs/Ltr of residual sugar it isn't properly sweet. What you get is a spicy full and really quite sleek style, the fruit is a little more macerated with stewed pears and apple. Still good acid balance so it doesn't ever overwhelm and then a creamy honeyed tactile finish. Good with wash rind cheeses and fruit tarts or perhaps a Moroccan chicken tagine.
2019 CHÂTEAU DE TRACY Pouilly Fumé Henri d'Assay,26.5,The wines of the d'Assay family are rightly lauded for the high quality and incredible consistency they deliver and this release is no different. In their youth the wines are taut and pure, with aromatics of youthful green fruit, gooseberry, citrus and a hint of that characteristic gunflint. In the mouth that shape is continued and the crispness of the fruit makes the mouth water, lean and fresh, with mineral drive and tension. It is well worth popping some bottles away to drink in a few years, when everything loosens off and the fruit enriches and matures into elderflower and white currant and something distinctly herbal can start to be felt.
2007 CHÂTEAU DE CÉRONS Cérons,26.5,Caroline Perromat describes this as 
2017 PIESPORTER GOLDTRÖPCHEN Riesling Grosses Gewächs Weingut Lehnert-Veit,NaN,The great location- the Piesporter Goldtröpfchen is one of the best and best known locations in the world. 
2016 ZUANI Collio Bianco Riserva,27.95,Bright straw yellow, shading into pale gold. The characterful nose reveals subtle hints of toastiness and vanilla with distinct hints of citrus fruit. An impressive palate with well-extracted fruit, thanks in part to the late harvest. The complex, well-sustained palate is seamless from entry through to the leisurely finish.
2018 SAINT VÉRAN Les Pommards Domaine Daniel Barraud,27.75,From vines between 20-55 years old. More savoury than the 'En Crèches' - and a slightly fuller, riper fruit core holds sway. This weight and richness is surprising on the face of it as the cote the vines are on face North East and you'd expect a cooler feel - especially as the soils are poor and ideal for retaining line a nd freshness. However, the vines are in fact in a little dip that holds any heat. This is what gives that depth, power and weight. A great contrast to En Crèches. Deep and full. It will take time, but this impresses.
2019 SANCERRE Silex Chavignol Domaine Vincent Delaporte,27.95,NaN
2020 CLOUDY BAY Sauvignon Blanc,26.95,NaN
2018 KUMEU RIVER Ray's Road Chardonnay,27.95,Quite a 'stony' nose and already lots of fun. Seems more than a year more evolved than the 2019. At a very nice stage now. Fresh and minerally and super-crisp but quite satisfying and not meagre at all. Super-clean. Just right for current drinking. If only all white burgundy offered this accessibility (I'm talking both price and taste). Really quite long. A neat, complete wine. At the moment I prefer this to the more intense but unformed Rays Road 2019
2018 NAHI WHITE RIOJA Rivas de Tereso Sierra de Toloño,28.95,Viura, malvasía, calagraño ... a mixture of old varieties from five micro-vineyards over 80 years old in Villabuena de Álava. It is a different white, mineral, with a sweet nose, white flowers and smoky touches. Very subtle breeding.
2019 LIRAC Cuvée de la Reine des Bois Blanc Domaine de la Mordorée,28.95,A mix of most of the permitted white varieties (mostly Clairette, Grenache Blanc and Roussanne), the 2019 Lirac La Reine Des Bois Blanc is thrilling stuff, and I’d certainly put it up with any of the top Châteauneuf du Pape whites out there. Light gold hued with a clean, classy bouquet of crushed citrus, spiced pear, white flowers, and honeyed minerality, it hits the palate with medium to full-bodied richness, beautifully integrated acidity, and a great, salty, lip-smacking finish. It’s well worth seeking out and is ideal for enjoying over the coming 2-4 years (although I suspect it will last even longer).
2016 GRÜNER VELTLINER Von Stein Reserve Salomon Undhof,29.95,This really is the Jewel in the Crown. Made from 70 year old vines, it is creamy textured and packed with ripe white and yellow fruit flavours. As ever this is very racy, pure and mineral. There's plenty of texture here, as well as a lovely saline note on the finish that makes it ever so moreish. Delicious stuff.
2018 PIETRAINCATENATA Fiano Luigi Maffini,30.95,Denser than the Kratos with great concentration. An almost fleshy nose, loaded with peach and apple fruit. Beautiful bright lift on the palate keeps the energy levels high. Richly fruity, then a mineral line, fresh citrus zip and touch of chalkiness fine grip. Such great length. A wonderful mouthful of textured fruit. This is a complex, charming wine with great personality.
2018 RULLY BLANC Domaine Dureuil-Janthial,31.75,There's more to this than the négoce version, on both nose and palate, a richer texture and more open and filled-out aromatics. Lovely balance here.
2017 ENGELGARTEN Domaine Marcel Deiss,31.95,NaN
2019 RULLY 1er Cru La Pucelle Domaine Paul et Marie Jacqueson,31.75,As completely lovely as ever - crystalline purity, lift and mouth watering citrus juice, but delivered with such finesse.
2018 RULLY 1er Cru Grésigny Domaine Paul et Marie Jacqueson,31.95,Bottled a week earlier than the Pucelle, this was showing more 'in place'. Sometimes the Gresigny can seem to need a little longer to come round, but in this vintage it seems it will drink alongside the Pucelle.
2017 CHÂTEAUNEUF DU PAPE Tradition Domaine Jean Royer,32.5,All three of the 2017s showed well. The 2017 Châteauneuf-du-Pape has classic sweet red fruits, spice, and floral notes, and it’s medium to full-bodied, silky and elegant. The blend is 90% Grenache and 5% each of Cinsault and Syrah.
2018 FELTON ROAD Bannockburn Chardonnay,32.95,A tinge of green in the colour here, very refined, a hint of wild herbs, of thyme perhaps, with a light earthy note. The palate has beautifully honed fruit, just a creaminess and subtle almonds oak, with sweet pear and spiced pear compote, with a long, fine finish
2017 VERDICCHIO 'VIGNA' Il Cantico della Figura Riserva dei Castelli di Jesi Andrea Felici,32.95,After tasting the 'regular' bottling this Riserva is impressively different. From vines planted more than 50 years ago, the Vigna has more of everything. The taut and fresh frame is laced with beautiful acidity. Yet there is a power and firm drive here too. A broad power that gently impresses itself. Such purity is delicious and the length is wonderful with some stone and citrus fruit, firm pear and white peach notes. This is juicy, mouthwatering and yet still tightly wrapped, with plenty of life ahead of it. One to enjoy for many years.
2018 RULLY BLANC Chêne Domaine Dureuil-Janthial,33.75,Vincent tells us this is a very cold site with mineral, white soil. On the palate this has a super, brisk feel. Tasting from the tank there is a little CO2 for now, but also a bright mineral thread that dominates the fine feel and runs right through this. Chalky lemon drops and some crisp yellow grapefruit add the crisp touches of acidity. Delicious Rully. Long and intense. 
2019 SAVENNIÈRES Château de Plaisance,33.5,Wowsers this is intense, layers of fruit richness, quince, honey, hay and peach. Such gorgeous concentration, rich yet dry, textured and fruit filled, the finish is phenomenal as the acidity gives a zing and ping to the long finish. This is definitely a wine that lives long in the memory and is set up for a good few years of drinking pleasure.
2017 CHABLIS 1er Cru Troësmes Domaine Denis Pommier,33.95,Brighter still than the Croix aux Moines - this has lovely mineral push and lots of citrus ping. Intense. More zest and pith - but joyously fresh and finishes with a nicely saline line. A tightish finish - nice tension and poise here.
2018 CHABLIS 1er Cru Vaillons Domaine Moreau-Naudet,34.25,(30% barrel-aged) This is leaner than the Pargues, with a more restrained tenser feel. Neat and compact. Some apple crunch and then sweeter notes too add depth to the fruit core. The whole feel is of more measure and the weight is steady, immaculate balance. Less flashy perhaps - but serious and charming. Intense fruit and green herbs too. Then saline, seashore elements. Cool and delicious.
2018 CHABLIS 1er Cru Forêts Domaine Moreau-Naudet,34.25,(30% barrel-aged). Tasted after the Montmains. This is more straight and lean. Beautifully bright and clean - a 'ting' to this, a clarity of expression. Delicious crisp lines - the fruit is good but more yellow and green - peppy - and juicy. Mineral and fresh even if there is a weight to the fleshy core. Wet pebbles up front then bigger more full fruit flavours to the back. Nice play on the palate. A really enjoyable Chablis.
2018 CHABLIS 1er Cru Montmains Domaine Moreau-Naudet,34.25,(10% barrel-aged) Another riot on the palate. Fresh start, builds fast to a more measured ripe-fruited middle There is apple bite, firm peach, curd-like intensity to the citrus line and lovely orange blossom flowers. Some savour too, some seaweed - then gently textured dusty feel adds grip and focus on the back end. Just crunched sea-shell hints pepper the finish.
2017 POUILLY FUISSÉ Vieilles Vignes Les Crays Domaine Daniel Barraud,34.5,Pale after the 'La Verchère', quite a shy nose, then great purity. Volume and a supple delicate fresh liquid touch - lemon and ripe yellow citrus lifts it - energy and mineral purity are the keynotes. Immensely long.
2018 POUILLY FUISSÉ Vieilles Vignes La Verchère Domaine Daniel Barraud,34.75,Again a deliciously bright attack - but this has an imposing sense of weight and power in the shadows. Builds nicely - sleekly into quite a big broad polished weight. Gorgeous fruit. Firm white and yellow flesh. Sweet pear and tart peach fruit, nice bright notes. Delivery is impeccable. Big, but so smoothly done. 65 years old vines.
2018 POUILLY FUISSÉ sur la Roche Domaine Daniel Barraud,34.75,Damp pebbles on the nose - incredible mineral feel. Highest bit of the Rock of Vergisson, with intensely limestone soil. There is a bright and tight core of brilliant fruit here. Zipping citrus and crisp pear juice. Good energy is beautifully held by the gorgeous delicate mineral grip that builds so finely. This is heady, impressive stuff.
2019 LA GRANDE PIECE Anjou Château de Plaisance,34.95,This has the volume turned up to 11, a real beauty of a wine. Such incredible intensity of fruit, texture and acidity. Concentrated and taut at the moment, you can feel the deep draught of stone fruits, mineral bite, honeyed feel, but it is wound up and really quite powerful. A wine built to impress and one that will cellar for many a year.
2018 BIANCO SECCO DEL VENETO Cà del Merlo Quintarelli,35.95,NaN
2018 RULLY BLANC 1er Cru Vauvry Domaine Dureuil-Janthial,35.75,Lovely weight, freshness and fullness - and a premier cru level of flavour concentration. Gorgeous - super length with citrus a go-go.
2018 SAINT JOSEPH Blanc Domaine G&J Bott,34.95,This superb blend of 70% Roussanne and 30% Marsanne is a really successful White St Joseph. Their vines are just north of St Pierre de Boeuf, as with all their whites they train their vines up poles and over the top to create tall arches of foliage. This practice is popular in Burgundy with some exceptional growers (Lalou-Bize Leroy, Arnoux-Lachaux) but Julie and Graeme are the first here to embrace it. The vines are better shaded like this and the results are great. Aromatic and yet fresh, with firm apricot and white flower notes, bright citrus juiciness too. Really elegant white with a pretty floral lift.
2016 ENGELGARTEN Domaine Marcel Deiss,36.95,This stunning single vineyard blend of Riesling with Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir, initially shows such wonderful underlying minerality and fresh acidity that the sweetness never really comes to the fore, but there is lovely richness lurking. This is still young and bright but has all the components for a long and exciting life ahead. The gravels of Engelgarten emphasise the citrus flavours. Already very hard to resist.
2018 KUMEU RIVER Coddington Chardonnay,36.95,From a site that faces directly north and gets more of a tropical fruit character than the citrus and so “Can take heavier oak,” according to Michael Brajkovich. Just a touch of hazelnut and light toast, a pure line of lime fruit again, fabulous acidity, but touching on peach and nectarine-ripe juiciness. More flamboyant, but still taut and precise.
2018 SAINT AUBIN 1er Cru Sentier du Clou Domaine Fernand & Laurent Pillot,37.5,There's an attractive firmness in the middle here - as well as a certain palate weight - with a good finish full of freshness and movement.
2018 RULLY BLANC 1er Cru Margotés Domaine Dureuil-Janthial,37.75,Open and expressive nose. Really lovely sunny, ripe feel, with that classic freshness, a feel of limestone - salivating, captivating.
2017 POUILLY FUISSÉ Vieilles Vignes En Buland Domaine Daniel Barraud,38.5,En Buland is like La Roche with a touch of la Verchère, and then more than either of them. Big and bold on the palate after a shy and retiring nose. Savoury, saline and voluminously ripe too. Intense all the way through, the most complete of all, and very long.
2018 FELTON ROAD Block 2 Chardonnay,39.75,Made from 100% Mendoza clone. Intense mineral sense to this, with more limey fruit intenstity than the Block 6 perhaps, and a touch of creaminess off-setting a little bit flint in this bottling. Lovely balance, with salinity to the acidity and the ripeness of the fruit, gentle creamy oak.
2018 FELTON ROAD Block 6 Chardonnay,39.75, A little bit of flint and minerals here, 
2013 BURG Domaine Marcel Deiss,41.95,The 2013 Burg is a field blend of classical Alsatian grape varieties grown in a sheltered, south-facing vineyard in a cool, late-ripening terroir on colored marl soils with imbedded gypsum. This is a pure, finessed and firmly structured Burg that is tight but transparent, finessed and vital on the palate with its full body lifted by mineral finesse and lingering salinity.
2018 KUMEU RIVER Hunting Hill Chardonnay,42.95,From a slope above the Maté's vineyard replanted in 2000, this is flecked with green in colour, a little touch of fig, but lots of lime blossom finesse. The palate has such a blast of salinity, sheer and flowing, such gorgeous clarity and that blast of mineral salts. Outstanding.
2017 SANTENAY 1er Cru Clos des Gravières Domaine Hubert Lamy,43.95,You can taste the sun on this wine, like sun on hot rock - ripe and minerally with a lovely texture, taut and bright and firm, very straight.
2018 CHÂTEAUNEUF DU PAPE La Dame Voyageuse Domaine de la Mordorée,44.95,Round and supple, the full-bodied 2018 Chateauneuf du Pape La Dame Voyageuse is a large-scaled ball of plum and blackberry fruit and savory nuances. Hints of mocha, black olive and licorice bring added interest to this soft, easygoing offering that should be consumed over the next 6-8 years.
2015 SCHOFFWEG Domaine Marcel Deiss,44.95,The 2015 Schoffweg opens very clear and with powdery chalky flavors on the nose, where ripe white-seed fruit aromas and a touch of smokiness are displayed. Full-bodied, round and lush, with rich and juicy fruit, ripe acidity and fine tannins, this elegant Schoffweg reveals its concentration, finesse and purity only in the finish that is almost tropical but still precise and stimulating in its texture. This is a great and promising wine, and you don't have to wait for a long time to enjoy it.
2018 PULIGNY MONTRACHET Noyers Brets Domaine Fernand & Laurent Pillot,46.75,Nicely sleek and fresh, with volume in the middle and a good straight length and juicy appeal.
2018 KUMEU RIVER Mate's Vineyard Chardonnay,50.95,Maté Barjkovich's name lives on in this vineyard immediately opposite the winery and family home, all planted with the Mendoza clone. Gorgeous nose, quite opulent and pear and peach, so much vibrant, brilliant fruit and acid, moves into nougat, etched by beautiful acidity, the opulence and ripeness so nicely tempered by that core of structural acid, but delicate, always delicate.
2018 MEURSAULT Domaine Henri Germain,51.5,Sweetness and concentration here, purity and a rounded, warm nut and flower in the sun feel. A bit of a low-key beauty.
2017 CONDRIEU Chéry Domaine Rémi Niero,52.5,From a miniscule 0.8 hectare vineyard with vines averaging 70 years old, the Coteau du Chéry is considered to be one of the finest Viognier plots in Condrieu. Lees ageing with batonnage, 40% aged for 12 months in mostly new oak and 60% stainless steel. Richer fruit than Ravines, more precise and perfumed with notes of apricot, jasmine and orange peel, again the acidity is fresh and gives the wine real poise and drive, the spice from the fruit is really well integrated with the balance of oak lending a touch of vanilla but nothing more, really expressive and well made. 
2017 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET 1er Cru Champgains Domaine Fernand & Laurent Pillot,53.95,The Champgains has a taut nose. Certainly not taut on the palate. The wine has a sweet entry. It is full and weighty on the palate. This is less about the energy and vigour and more about the sheer volume and density of juice. Voluptuous. 
2017 CHABLIS Grand Cru Bougros Maison des Hâtes,54.75,This is all raised in wood - not all new though, with some barrels on their 3rd or 4th year. The feel is good and clean and perfectly 'Chablis'. There are super lines that drive through with lovely bright acidity. The fruit is intense and deep but for now still tightly wound. Yet it's clear there is lots to come. serious weight of minerality builds alongside that tight fruit bundle at the core. Precise lines and good tension balanced by lovely weighty, ripe fruit. It's all here a smart and complete Grand Cru. 
2016 MEURSAULT Luraule Domaine Rémi Jobard,57.75,The nose here is broader, with distinctive white fruit that follow on to the palate. Great intensity here. Rich fruit... some yellow flesh, some apple, some almost pineapple essence - but not so tart. Bright for sure, but the acidity is very well entwined with the fruit, giving great tension and balance.
2015 CHÂTEAUNEUF DU PAPE Les Sables de la Crau Domaine Jean Royer,57.95,Vivid ruby-red. Intense, sharply focused red fruit liqueur, spicecake and floral scents are complicated by suggestions of smoky minerals and Asian spices. Sappy, penetrating and appealingly sweet, offering silky raspberry and lavender pastille flavors that put on weight and spread out steadily with air. Closes smooth, sweet and impressively long, displaying suave, fine-grained tannins and resonating florality.
2017 BLANC DE LYNCH BAGES Château Lynch Bages,59.95,The 2017 Blanc de Lynch Bages, which was slightly affected by frost, especially the Sauvignon Blanc, had been bottled the previous week. A blend of 40% Sauvignon Blanc, 41% Sémillon and 19% Muscadelle and matured in 45% new oak, it has a fresh green apple and gooseberry scented bouquet with the Sauvignon firmly in charge. The palate is well balanced with a fine thread of acidity, touches of grapefruit, melon and pineapple leading to a slightly blank but fresh finish that will need a year in bottle to develop more personality.
2016 MEURSAULT Narvaux Domaine Rémi Jobard,NaN,An appealing fresh and bright nose consists of green fruit, hazelnut and citrus zest aromas. Here too the vibrant and more mineral-inflected flavors possess a pliant mid-palate though there is so much sappy extract that the bone dry finish is almost chewy. One to consider if you have the patience to cellar it for a few years.
2016 MEURSAULT Chevalières Domaine Rémi Jobard,61.95,Wow this is bigger still and bursting with acidity too. Delicious mix of tropical and crisp yellow plum skin. Intense, powerful and full of energy. Impressive stuff.
2017 MEURSAULT 1er Cru Caillerets Domaine Fernand & Laurent Pillot,62.95,The creaminess is evident on the nose. Clearly Meursault. The palate reveals precise, pure fruit, a touch of mineral tension but all wound up in a smooth, creamy, textured juice. Immediately appealing, this will give drinking pleasure for the next seven years. 
2018 CERVARO Antinori Castello della Sala,59.95,The 2018 Cervaro della Sala is a luminous straw yellow in color streaked with occasional greenish highlights. The nose shows light toasted notes accompanied by aromas of citrus fruit, tropical fruit, and hints of butter. The palate is notably savory and fresh, con characteristics of chamomile, white fruit, and flint along with a pleasurable persistence and tasting depth. Its youth, although already inviting and enjoyable, announces much capacity for aging. The wine, still quite young, will evolve in an optimal fashion in the years to come.
2018 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET 1er Cru Vide Bourse Domaine Fernand & Laurent Pillot,63.5,Still in tank when we tasted. Rich and full, quite closed in aromas, but definitely all here and has a considerable richness, which is tugged out long on the finish by bright acidity.
2016 MEURSAULT 1er Cru Caillerets Domaine Fernand & Laurent Pillot,68.95,Already bottled. More nutty. More woody, more mineral. Nice, pear fruit. A tasty, grippy middle. Then mineral notes take over. Not blockbusting but good drive and length. 
2017 PULIGNY MONTRACHET Joseph Drouhin,67.5,Lovely Puligny like flavours. Quite powerfully broad - with a softish weight that reels you in - and yet the style is nicely pure and mineral. Clever balance between plush pleasure and purity of Puligny - which when done well is a signature of the 2017 vintage. Not as diamond cut as some years but with great power and it gives great joy. Well concentrated and quite weighty really.
2012 ALTENBERG DE BERGHEIM Grand Cru Domaine Marcel Deiss,68.95,The Altenberg 2012 is immensely rich and concentrated, but this is all balanced with powerful acidity so that it is surprisinly serene in its power and the richness is never overpowering. Ripe tropical fruit and honey volume and thickness are set against driving citrus and powerful length. Although still young, this is now ready to approach.
2017 PULIGNY MONTRACHET Tremblots Domaine Hubert Lamy,NaN,The 'younger' vines that make up this plot are now 40 years old, the older ones over 80. Clay and limestone. Expressive again, juicily aromatic 'a bit phenolic', says Olivier, going on to explain that when it's this ripe he can attack the pressing with several rebêchages (breaking down the matted pressed skins and re-loading the press for another go), as the phenolic side will not show as vegetal because of the ripeness, and the extract will help the wine age well. There's a powerful density which shows great promise.
2019 CHACRA CHARDONNAY Bodega Chacra,73.95,A flat-out stunner. Wow. What a wine. Initially restrained and taut, then gains body with time. We finished the bottle before I could see too much evolution in the glass 😊. From Jean-Marc Roulot and Piero Incisa, dedicated to the memory of Ned Benedict. This is a very special wine... 
2016 BLANC DE LYNCH BAGES Haut Médoc Château Lynch Bages,79.95,52% Sauvignon Blanc, 30% Semillon, 18% Muscadelle. Such clever winemaking: a lovely mix of sweetness than tantalises and sets off the bright nettley and acidulous elements of Sauvignon Blanc. Bravo.
2016 PULIGNY MONTRACHET 1er Cru Les Champgains Domaine Faiveley,82.95,An overtly floral-suffused nose exhibits additional breadth in the form of citrus, apple and petrol scents. There is both better precision and minerality to the chalky and textured medium-bodied flavors that terminate in a chiseled and saline finish.
2017 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET 1er Cru Caillerets Domaine Joseph Colin,82.95,A great classic of a vineyard, and as it sounds, a rocky, white soil, very mineral. Discreet nose, very pure and straight. Rock crystal elegance here, very fine - there's thickness of body yet total purity. Magical site-specific combination of ripeness and brightness.
2017 MEURSAULT 1er Cru Poruzots Domaine Henri Boillot,84.95,This is perky and brightly inviting. A tangy, lemon note runs right through this and plays well alongside a charmingly, chalky mineral line. Pure and correct and very pretty Meursault.
2003 DOMAINE DE CHEVALIER Blanc Cru Classé Pessac-Léognan,107.75,‘Starts off slowly on the palate then develops into a blast of mineral, apple, honey, pineapple and light vanilla on the nose and palate. Full-bodied, with wonderful freshness and an extremely long aftertaste. I still remember this wonderful wine's finish. 92-94’ James Suckling, Wine Spectator
2005 DOMAINE DE CHEVALIER Blanc Cru Classé Pessac-Léognan,107.75,Bright and defined balance, with an attractively round grapefruity quality which lingers in the fresh acidity on the finish.
2017 BEAUNE 1er Cru Clos des Mouches Domaine Joseph Drouhin,143.95,Jérôme Faure Brac, the oenologist, is all about low intervention in the winery as he wants vineyard expression to be key. He therefore made six different harvests here from the 1st to the 6th of September. The Drouhin team sub-divide this large Clos vineyard (7Ha) into different parcels. Harvested and vinified separately they are only blended after élevage in barrel. This is almost a year and then the blend 'assembles' for 2-3 months in tank together before bottling. The results are great. With impressive breadth and structure. There is a nice intensity to the crisp-edged, yellow fruit. Not peachy but quite ripe citrus character and nice persistence. This has impact and depth, there's lots to like and this will become even more exciting with a few years in the cellar. 
2004 PAVILLON BLANC Château Margaux,255.0,Very interesting mineral side to this along with the floral and fruity. Very elegant although it is very full - one really does not notice its 14.5% alcohol in terms of its freshness and feel. The finish stays sweet-tasting and fresh, and it is very long.
2007 PAVILLON BLANC Château Margaux,275.0,NaN
2019 RUSTENBERG Straw Wine,10.5,Made in the traditional 'Passito' way this 'Straw Wine' is delicious, and a real bargain to boot. After picking the grapes - they are laid out on woven mats next to the winery to dry in the sunshine and intensify their flavour and sweetness, The results are incredibly satisfying - sweet, yet still bright, fresh and complex, with honeyed characters and hints of lemon. The perfect partner for your favourite pudding!
2018 POUILLY FUMÉ Domaine Hervé Séguin,10.95,This really showcases the qualities of the 2018 vintage. Ripe and intense with lovely shape and depth, plenty of rich citrus, gooseberry fruit, then that tell tale gun flint, almost touch chalky intensity from the soil. Good acid lift that gives balance to ripe fruit on the palate, this is really lovely to drink.
2014 COTEAUX DU LAYON BEAULIEU L'Anclaie Château de Pierre Bise,17.95,'Sélection de Grains Nobles' from Chenin Blanc harvested at the peak of botrytisation. The Papin family's vineyards are picked over several weeks and fermented long and slow to produce some of the world's great sweet wines which are balanced by the powerful natural acidity of the Chenin grape. Intense, long and unforgettable.
2019 KUMEU RIVER Chardonnay Coddington,19.95,Firm and serious. Clean lines. A decisive feel. Bright sparks here. Delicious. Much more excitement and more energy than the Hunting Hill which has huge charm, but is broader. The Coddington is deep and layered, just so detailed - yet with great weight of spiced white fruit. A fantastic effort.
2019 KUMEU RIVER Chardonnay Hunting Hill,23.95,As we tasted through the line-up of these 2019s - the Hunting Hill stood out for its open feel and instant charm, The broad and expansive nose leads to a lively palate. Intense and nicely concentrated - with great acid pep and fruit bite. This has a long, fun time ahead - but is already hard to resist. Nice lick of cream in the back. Creamier feel and really pleasing. This will charm all comers. 
2019 KUMEU RIVER Chardonnay Mate's Vineyard,26.95,The Mate's Vineyard is planted with the 'Mendoza' clone of Chardonnay and always has a smartly distinct personality. Broad and deep nose. Nice flashes here of what is to come. Bright highlights pick up the seriousness and the unrelenting push across the palate. This has power and brood - an intensity that is impressive. Some savour and some tight fruit notes. Its all here - but this is going to need time to get to its most showy and joyful. One to be patient for but deeply impressive.
2013 QUARTS DE CHAUME Château de Pierre Bise,31.95,The very pinnacle of Loire valley sweet wines. 100% Chenin Blanc lending crisp acidity to the fresh white fruit palate. Zippy and bright in youth, this will age magnificently picking up deeper honeyed tones as it goes.
2011 TOKAJI ASZÚ 5 PUTTONYOS Disznókő,31.95,The classic Tokaji balancing deep marmalade characters with clean fresh acidity.
2014 QUARTS DE CHAUME Château de Pierre Bise,33.95,Notes of spiced apple and pear with some lovely honey and chamomile touches. The palate is ripe and concentrated with a creamy honeyed richness, but then you get that balancing bright Chenin acidity to lift the finish.
2016 BOURGOGNE BLANC Vieilles Vignes Domaine Rémi Jobard,63.95,One foudre and the remainder in barriques. An elegant aroma. Juicy strike to a rounded palate. There is quite some richness here too. It is fresh and lemony on the finish. It is ripe, but not too rich. Jolly nice indeed.
2015 BOURGOGNE BLANC Domaine Rémi Jobard,64.95,Beautifully fat and rich - a Meursault Villages quality in many cellars - bright and firm, with a lovely long, lemony finish. I went back to this after tasting the Premiers Crus and it still showed fantastically well - fat and pure.
2015 QUARTS DE CHAUME Confidence Grand Cru Château de Plaisance,66.95,Intense and bright, with a citrus edge to the pear, pineapple and apricot fruits. In the mouth the intensity of fruit never lessens, complex, with honey and just a touch of creaminess, pineapple and apricot, with a citrus tang to the long finish.
2017 KUMEU RIVER Chardonnay Coddington,67.95,Wow. As ever the Coddington stands out for being riper, richer and more showy than the other releases. And in 2017 it still has the trademark is a luscious peach note. But for now this is perhaps less exuberant than in recent years. Yes there is more weight and a richer feel - but plenty of bite too from a decent slug of acidity. adds a ginger and limey note charming, quite taught - but with great texture and commanding density. The Brajkovichs are now running the Coddington vineyard completely, but they do not own it sadly. They are leasing it on a year by year basis - but have full control - for now, long may this last.... 
2015 VIRÉ-CLESSÉ Sélection EJ Thévenet Domaine de la Bon Gran,32.95,Tropical fruits on the nose, banana and marzipan, burnt butter, condensed milk. Concentrated and bold style, creamy yet back by bright acid on the palate. Yellow plum, quince, ripe citrus, with hints of butter, toffee, fior di latte ice cream. Complete, rich and yet beautifully balanced. Wow i love these wines!!
2017 DEMORGENZON Reserve Chenin Blanc,70.5,Oz Clarke: A rich style that's oaky and full. Notes of nuts, honeysuckle and syrup. It’s decent now, but will be even more exciting in a few years. Sarah Jane Evans: Aromas of honeyed apples. The palate is ripe and buttery with a lovely edge of lemon zest, plus nutmeg and cinnamon spice. Tina Gellie: Full-bodied enough to carry its alcohol and oak. Apple crumble, lemon and stone fruit on the nose and palate. Characterful. Recommended by Simon Field MW 
2017 KUMEU RIVER Chardonnay Hunting Hill,78.5,The Hunting Hill vineyard always produces wines that are more taught and mineral. And here the nose does not disappoint, focused and with powdery floral notes. White and pithy citrus notes follow to the pallet. There is great energy and fresh cut here. Smart, restrained oak notes come in later - warm and nicely textured. The weight builds - but that focus never slides. Great.
